Apple's long and controversial ebook case has reached its final chapter — and it's not the happy ending the company wanted.
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal filed by Apple to overturn a stinging ruling that it led a broad conspiracy with several major publishers to fix the price of e-books sold through its online bookstore.
The court's decision means Apple now has no choice but to pay out $400 million to consumers and an additional $50 million in legal fees, according to the original settlement in 2014.

For Apple, the final verdict is more damaging to its reputation as a consumer-friendly brand, not to mention the legacy of its beloved founder Steve Jobs, than to its actual bottom line.
To put the fine in context, the total $450 million payout is equal to about a little more than half the sales Apple generates on average each day, based on the $75.9 billion in revenue it reported in the most recent quarter.
The price-fixing episode dates back to late 2009, just ahead of the original iPad launch. Apple and its founder, recognizing that books would likely be a big selling point of the tablet, began courting what were then the big five book publishers.
In a series of e-mails, later released by the U.S. government, Jobs personally persuaded publishing industry executives to re-think the flat $9.99 e-book pricing previously imposed by Amazon, then (and now) the giant of the e-book world.
""All the major publishers tell us that Amazon’s $9.99 price for new releases is eroding the value perception of their products in customer’s minds, and they do not want this practice to continue for new releases."" Jobs wrote in one email to James Murdoch, an executive at News Corp, which owns Harper Collins.

An email Apple CEO Steve Jobs sent to News Corp exec James Murdoch.Image:  screengrab,  mashableThe major publishers, unhappy about the unfavorable terms they'd agreed to with Amazon, signed on to Apple's plan and later used the new competition to pressure Amazon into changing its own pricing structure.
While some in the publishing industry argued this move helped break up Amazon's potential monopoly on the market, the U.S. government accused Apple and the five publishers of colluding to keep prices high.
The publishers — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster — all settled with the Department of Justice before going to trial. 
Only Apple, armed with the unwavering belief in its own rightness, argued the case in the courts. 
""We are ready to distribute the court-mandated settlement funds to Kindle customers as soon as we’re instructed to move forward,"" a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement provided to Mashable.
Reps for Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the Supreme Court decision. However, a company statement after its big loss in court in 2013 says it all. 
""When we introduced the iBookstore in 2010, we gave customers more choice, injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry,"" Apple said in a statement at the time. ""We've done nothing wrong.""
The U.S. courts have once again determined otherwise.

There is a reason that Donald Trump's outrageous statements and behavior feel familiar to many women. 
It's not because they know his declarative style and trademark shrug from reality television or political debates. Nor is it because his outsized role in American business made an unforgettable impression on them.
SEE ALSO: As Donald Trump targets women, Republicans say he could cost the party everything
The eerie familiarity is more personal than that. They know Trump because they've encountered a man like him at home, work, on social media or in a relationship. 
This man extols the virtues of women, but has no problem reducing them to sex objects. He casts himself as unflappable, but blames a woman when his weaknesses are revealed. He insists on personal responsibility, but denies, deflects and perhaps even turns violent when accused of wrongdoing. 

The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016

The psychological warfare of gaslighting, a subtle form of emotional abuse that puts the victim on the defensive, is his go-to strategy.    
This is not how Trump sees himself or his actions, but it is arguably the image he projects to voters. On Tuesday, when Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery of a female reporter, Trump issued a series of tweets refuting the video evidence, discrediting the journalist and implying she could have been a dangerous or deadly threat. 

Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016

Powerful women on the left and right forcefully criticized Trump's reaction to the charges. 
“Too often victims of violence and abuse stay silent, and Donald Trump’s remarks today demonstrate one of the reasons why,"" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. ""His actions today underscore that it is a fiction that he has been or would be supportive of any woman in this country.""

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. pic.twitter.com/N5815RS1At
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016


Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016

On Wednesday, a group of conservative female journalists and commentators called for Lewandowski's firing.
Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones.

Nichole Bauer, assistant professor in the political science department at the University of Alabama, says the response was classic Trump. He's practiced at denying previous statements even when incontrovertible evidence of them exists. While this isn't exclusive to his commentary about women, Trump has a track record of making his female targets — and their defenders — seem like the foolish ones. 
Of course he wasn't making a reference to menstruation when he joked about Fox anchor Megyn Kelly having ""blood coming out of her wherever"" during a debate. And no, he most certainly did not use schlonged as a vulgar term when describing how badly Pres. Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. 

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2016

""There’s definitely an accepted belief among the Republican and Democratic mainstream that this sort of outmoded sexism that Donald Trump demonstrates has no real place in discourse,"" says Bauer. 
Yet, instead of apologizing, or acknowledging how the woman in question — or any woman, for that matter — might find his remarks offensive, Trump doubled down and obfuscated reality. 
Many women have been here before, whether it's with a coworker who denies the meaning of a sexist comment or a partner who is quick to end an argument by using the word emotional. 
...he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men.
Trump's denials may make him appear unassailable to some, but to women they send an entirely different message, says Bauer. By denying the nature of his commentary and behavior, he's telling women that they don't deserve the same respect and agency as men. 
While Republican women tend to support traditional roles, Bauer says, they do so believing that deference to a male authority figure or husband is their choice. Trump's faultless behavior effectively takes that autonomy away from them by creating a political climate in which the woman is always wrong. 
This may explain why he performed so poorly with Republican women in one recent survey. That NBC/WSJ poll found that 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump. His favorability ratings were higher, at 59%, amongst registered Republican women in a CNN/ORC poll, though it did not ask whether they intended to vote for him.

""@Don_Vito_08: ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8""
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016

These polls also don't fully reflect his recent, unseemly attacks on Heidi Cruz, wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz, or his statement on Wednesday that if abortion is banned, women who have one illegally should ""face some sort of punishment."" 
Though Trump immediately clarified that comment as a response to a hypothetical question and then reversed his position, it's clear that he's not only willing to publicly embarrass and degrade women, but also consider depriving them of physical freedom. 
Such power dynamics aren't hypothetical to women in abusive workplaces or relationships, who cannot fathom a political reality that mirrors their private hell. 
""People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack.""
Jackie White, emerita professor of psychology and a senior research scientist at the Center for Women’s Health and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says an approach that victimizes women and then blames them for playing a part in their degradation is about manipulation. 
""People are doing it as a strategy to control others and elevate themselves and insulate themselves from attack,"" she says. ""They’re going to present themselves as a very self-assured, knowledgable person."" 
Meanwhile, such behavior silences the victim. She may feel depressed, passive or paralyzed. Feelings of doubt and insecurity set in. Women know this experience well, says White. 
She worries, however, that the tactics on display in the campaign could send just as powerful a message to men as to women. 
Trump's behavior may consciously or subconsciously lead some men to endorse harmful stereotypes and engage in emotional manipulation, particularly if they feel threatened by social and demographic change and evolving gender roles.
""[Trump's] actions could inspire them to feel justified in clinging to what they see as their deserved elevated status,"" White says. 
That's what makes Donald Trump so dangerous. Even if he's offering the public a performance, the fallout is unconscionable for both women and men.

3,Scott Gerber,[],5000,"Today's digital marketing experts must have a diverse skill set, including a sophisticated grasp of available media channels, the ability to identify up-and-coming opportunities, on top of having the basic skills of a brilliant marketer. What's more, they have to possess a balance of critical and creative thinking skills in order to drive measurable success for their company.
That's why I asked 15 members of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) what they look for when hiring digital marketers. Their best answers are below.
1. Paid social media advertising expertise

A new digital marketing hire should be well-versed in paid social media advertising, especially through Facebook or a similar social platform that our company uses regularly. They need to be able to understand and implement Facebook analytics and insights, create ""lookalike"" and custom audiences, experiment and test creative campaign and images, and be secure in their knowledge of the overall social media landscape. There are many budget-saving opportunities within the social media advertising space, so we want to make sure that our digital marketing talent knows the ins and outs of this popular and easy-to-implement marketing space. 
— Miles Jennings, Recruiter.com
SEE ALSO: Web developers, data scientists, AI experts: The 15 top tech roles of 2016

2. Sales skills

We've hired many digital marketers over the years, both outsourced and in-house. What we've found is that people who have sold successfully are much better marketers. They know how to engage with people and turn them into sales opportunities. While your digital marketers may not be closing deals directly, they need to know how to sell or they'll be wasting your valuable marketing dollars without generating qualified lead opportunities for your sales team. 
— Mark Cenicola, BannerView.com
3. Specific marketing channel expertise 

I see so many marketers who extol the virtues of every conceivable marketing channel: email, SEO, SEM, social, etc. And many channels might work for you, but the key to a successful marketing strategy is focusing on a few channels and using them really well. Often that means understanding the dynamics of that marketing channel deeply and leveraging those dynamics for your specific company. For example, in helping local businesses, Pinterest is less interesting (although it's one of the best drivers of ecommerce traffic). I'd much rather focus on the intricate tactics of local SEO to get a client to No. 1 on Google, Maps and Yelp.
— Trevor Sumner, LocalVox
4. The ability to think objectively 

Marketers are usually one of the most passionate workers in the office. However, that passion can often cloud the judgment and measurement of marketing theories and initiatives. A marketer who can separate themselves from their work will navigate with an objective eye that can focus on what actually works — not just what they hoped would work.
— Wesley Mathews, High Level Marketing
5. The ability to execute and analyze drip marketing campaigns

Inbound marketing is a key skill in driving lead generation. While many marketers can come up with an initial innovative engagement strategy or CPC campaign, what intrigues me more is how they examine the incoming data and create a robust drip marketing campaign. Great automation on these campaigns is not about sending the same email to the entire flock that the campaign gathers. It's about personal, well-written communication that varies depending on the actions performed seven emails deep into the campaign. That's a lot of variation, and requires an analytical mindset and strategic thinking. Exceptional marketing happens when the art of communication expands upon the fundamental science of conversion. 
— Eran Eyal, Springleap 
SEE ALSO: 11 things your startup should look for in a creative hire for 2016

6. A mix of creativity and analytical abilities

Digital marketing requires both creative thinking and analytical thinking, so we look for a candidate capable of and excited about both. Many new candidates want to focus purely on one or the other, but it's important to bring ""art and science"" to each digital program. Digital marketing allows us to be very measurable — even for beautiful creative campaigns — using analytics to inform future strategies. 
— Kayla Wagner Faires, Revel Interactive
7. Good copy and visual storytelling abilities 

Digital media is a copy- and visual-driven medium unlike any other before it. Our social heart is won over (or double clicked on) by copy that is relevant and visuals that pull on our emotional strings. The native understanding and ability to manipulate those two elements is critical in today's digital marketing landscape. 
— Alex Frias, Track Marketing Group
8. A likable personality

Relationship building is such a huge component of digital marketing, and a likable personality can go a long way. With so many people trying to connect with publishers, bloggers, journalists and influencers, someone with a great personality will always stand out and command attention. If you are being pitched by two similar people and one person is the equivalent to talking to a brick wall and the other person is outgoing and pleasant, who are you going to give your time to? The same applies to maintaining relationships — having a likable personality plays such a huge role, yet it's often overlooked. 
— Jonathan Long, Market Domination Media

9. An understanding of WordPress

With so many platforms now built on WordPress, it is a vital technical tool to add to your toolbox. If you want to create and manage a blog or even a website, WordPress has become the go-to platform for digital marketers. It also helps to continually educate yourself on new plug-ins and functionality because WordPress is always offering something new and useful that speeds up content production. 
— Angela Ruth, Due.com 
10. Self-promotion savvy 

If you're telling me that you have a strong understanding of social media and leveraging brands, then it should be very easy for you to do the same with your own. My interviewees are their own first project, and I use information I can find on them to make my final decision. Something should come up when I search their names, preferably on all the same platforms that I want to use for my clients. Messaging and vis-a-vis skills should be consistent across most platforms, and some obvious care should be put into the presentation and expansion of each one.
— Adam Steele, The Magistrate
11. Understanding of brevity

It doesn't matter how good your product is if you can't communicate your value proposition to potential customers in fewer than 140 characters. Digital marketers must be efficient and effective with minimal messaging. 
— Nicholas Haase, Loot!
12. The ability to analyze quantifiable metrics

Now, more than ever, being able to quantify the value of investing in marketing and advertising is vital. The battle for supremacy in the marketplace is not won in whole percentage points any longer. It's about making the right choices and moving the needle slightly forward at every opportunity. Digital marketing consultants need to possess the competencies and the general knowledge required to provide actionable metrics, and prove their value with real data. Gone are the days of guessing whether or not a campaign was effective based on simple sales numbers. In-page tracking, coupled with analytics and metrics software are the tools of the day for marketers, and we expect any new consultants or team members to be able to leverage those tools to ensure accuracy and efficacy.
— Blair Thomas, EMerchantBroker

13. Listening skills

As a digital marketer, our ability to promote our services through words, images, video and social media are essential. Digital marketing also provides an opportunity for its specialists to listen to various groups of people, from clients to consumers, in new ways. Through social media and analytical tools, we can listen to our consumers' thoughts on a product, relevant issue or our own services. When I hire a digital marketer, I'll see if they've sought to listen to consumer and client needs and create a solution from their own observations or insights. 
— Shalyn Dever, Chatter Buzz
14. Agility

At least once a month a new platform pushes its way into relevancy, or a major platform adjusts its algorithm. If you're/they're operating on a methodology devised without flexibility, and/or aren't the type of person to be able to react appropriately, you and your business will fall behind the curve and lose ground fast. 
— Mickey Meyer, JASH
15. Basic design skills

Being able to communicate a message properly is extremely important. However, digital marketing involves more than just words. A large part of digital marketing is about visual appearance. Anyone who calls themselves a digital marketer should have at least some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS or Photoshop. 
— Dan Sapozhnikov, AdGate Media

",15 essential skills all digital marketing hires must have,,,,,0
4,Josh Dickey,http://mashable.com/people/joshdickey/,1600,"LOS ANGELES — For big, fun, populist popcorn movies, 2015 was a grand fireworks show with a blowout finale. For quiet adult dramas and prestige films, it started with a pop … and ended in a fizzle.
That’s why I struggled mightily to fill out a Top 10 for 2015, the biggest year ever at the North American box office. It’s also why this list is overwhelmed with blockbusters and populist hits.
SEE ALSO: Diversity report card: The film industry took 1 step forward, 2 steps back
And none packed more firepower than Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Mashable’s No. 1 movie of the year. Using a “best-in-show” mentality — that the biggest prize goes to the most fulfilling representation of its breed — there really is no contest in the Year of the Blockbuster.
As for the rest, well … I asked Mashable’s fellow film buffs to help weigh in, because frankly, though I saw more movies this year than any other, I couldn’t come up with 10 films from 2015 that I loved enough to grant year-end-best honors.
There were many titles that walked up to the line: The Revenant, Carol, Anomalisa, Creed and Ex Machina were all on the bubble, and I’d hoped my colleagues' enthusiasm might push them over the line. It didn’t. (They did, however, rescue The Martian and The Big Short, films I liked very much but didn’t love-love.)
I’m not declaring 2015 a bad year for movies (I did that last year, and stand by it). It was just a lopsided one, a year in which the truly best films were also the biggest. Without a single major indie or “prestige” breakout at the box office, audiences clearly agreed.
All of that in mind, here's Mashable’s Top 10 for 2015:
No. 1: Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Deeply, deeply conflicted about this movie, I am. 
It's a remix of Star Wars: A New Hope, right down to its ships and vehicles, which puzzlingly have not evolved since their 1977 models. Neither have the costumes, the hairstyles, the weaponry, the MacGuffins, the major plot points or the presence of that one portly X-Wing pilot.
Disney and Lucasfilm basically recreated your old bedroom for you but put some awesome new toys in it, and the strategy could not have been more effective. For all its glaring faults, The Force Awakens was breathless fun to watch and re-watch, it made us talk and feel and tweet and write endlessly, it will make $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 at the box office — and it did so with two unknown actors in lead roles. 
What did you think was the best movie of 2015? If your answer was anything but Star Wars: The Force Awakens, try again. What other movie surrounds us, binds us, and brings us together? Said my colleague Adam Rosenberg: ""I saw someone say the tacit social media ban on Star Wars spoilers is the closest we got to world peace in 2015. They're not wrong.""
No. 2: Spotlight

The biggest exception to the ""Year of Blockbusters"" is Spotlight, the presumptive front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar, and for good reason. 
Nothing at all fancy here: Just a handful of our best actors digging into a great script. Lean, focused and exciting, this portrait of the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning stories exposing systematic sexual abuse in the Catholic Church played more like a heist thriller. 
And it isn't just a Thing Journalists Like. Said my colleague Megan Hess: ""Beyond giving media folks a more modern movie reference than All The President's Men, this film showed the power of questioning things around you — which is, frankly, something we should all be doing more of.""
SEE ALSO: 'Spotlight' movie review: A thrilling dive into masterful journalism
No. 3: Inside Out

In terms of developing ""emotional intelligence,"" Inside Out was better than a year's worth of therapy sessions. 
Pete Docter's vision of making emotions into characters was too daring, too out-there to be this clear in its purpose. And the payoff — that all the emotions are valuable, even the unpleasant ones — actually changed my life in a meaningful way. On some deep, resonant level, this was my No. 1 movie of 2015, and certainly one of my all-time favorites, period.
SEE ALSO: 'Inside Out' review: You will walk out of the theater knowing yourself better 
No. 4: Mad Max: Fury Road

The consensus No. 1 among critics and movie bloggers deserves its place there; in terms of pure auteurism, George Miller hits the gas and runs away with 2015's most compelling theater-going experience, period. 
This budget-busting, deeply ""troubled"" retread of an aging franchise should have been a disaster. It wasn't. Instead, we got the freshest-looking hero/heroine flick of the decade. 
Bumped down a few spots on my list for its thin ""drive away, drive back"" storyline, but that's not a knock. Said my colleague Kate Sommers-Dawes: ""That was a totally unexpected, shiny-and-chrome thrill. I laughed, I cried, I rejoiced at the feminist utopia suggested by the last scene. Also probably a preview of a Donald Trump presidency so ... start your water hoarding now.""

No. 5: Straight Outta Compton

F. Gary Gray's film about the rise of N.W.A. was sharp, propulsive, brisk and brash — so much so that to hang ""biopic"" on this one seems ... off. 
Standout performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins earned this one a Screen Actors Guild nomination for ensemble, and it's criminal that none of these guys seems to be seriously contending for an Oscar. And at  $161 million in North America, audiences also thought that shit was doooooope.

No. 6: The Martian

Everybody loves The Martian. I thought it was good, clean, forgettable fun — nothing about its themes stirred me — but it's more or less a unanimous choice among my colleagues and peers. So here it is.

No. 7: Ant-Man

Marvel showed another, funnier side with Ant-Man, establishing a new comic-relief character — and probably just in time, as a palate cleanser to the cool but often wearisome Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ant-Man works as a piece of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also makes for a fun, silly one-off, to the tune of half-a-billion dollars worldwide.

No. 8: The Big Short

Another one voted in by my colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed The Big Short and certainly learned something from it, but its ensemble of middle-aged white dudes, explanatory hurdles and hinky edits didn't scream ""Top 10"" to me. But definitely worth your time — and should have a second life in high-school economics classes as an annual watch when the teacher is out sick.

No. 9: Dope

I loved this movie, despite it being about 30 minutes too long. Some called it ""John Hughes in the Hood,"" and I'm buying that distillation — the characters felt real, their predicaments felt real, the story felt real, and yet everything was utterly absurd and over the top. With clever nods to popular culture across at least three decades and a deeply satisfying payoff, Dope would've charted a lot higher in my personal Top 10.

No. 10: While We’re Young

The tension between Gen X and Millennials is real, it's widespread, and it's never been more accurately or hilariously depicted than in Noah Baumbach's While We're Young. I like Baumbach — he's quietly becoming our Woody Allen/Mike Nichols — but I was caught completely off-guard by how much I loved While We're Young, which skewers both generations pointedly but without bitterness. 
Everyone else loved these films — they just didn’t make the cut for me
Carol: Strong contender for just about every Oscar there is, and deservedly so; it just left me slightly cold. Really nothing to criticize, except maybe the gratuitous puking scene.
The Revenant: Gorgeous, made with incredible skill, but only enjoyable as a one-off cinematic experience. I enjoyed every minute, and have no desire — nay, no need whatsoever — to ever see this again.
Anomalisa: Charlie Kaufman's animated movie is a mini-marvel. The puppets are, in some ways, more human than humans; the interior of the hotel looks more like a hotel than a real-life hotel. The whole thing has something very striking to say about the frailty of human desire. This should probably be in the Top 10.
Ex Machina: A near-masterpiece that was undone by its jarring, oblique ending.
Creed: We can all agree that Ryan Coogler is one of the best young directors in Hollywood and Creed was a bona fide hit, both critically and commercially. But boxing hasn't looked this cartoonish since ... well, the original Rocky films. There are at least 25 hits in this movie that would end any given match in real-life. I just can't let that pass.
Hateful Eight: Quentin Tarantino's apparent homage to John Carpenter's The Thing could've been the greatest 90 minutes in 2015. Instead, the distraction of road-show bells and whistles (70mm projection, overture, intermission), a few overly hammy performances and at least a full hour of fat made this one a slog to sit through.
Room: Easily my least favorite film of 2015. Exploitative, manipulative, cloying, suffocating. I nearly left the theater 20 minutes in, and now I wish I had. The confinement section was a dreary hell; the ""escape"" scene was clumsy and sloppily executed; the life-after-escape was draggy and hopeless. 
Not nearly as bad as advertised
Jupiter Ascending: The Wachowskis' gorgeous visuals and a unique take on our place in the galaxy were undermined by a few things, not the least of which is bad casting: Mila Kunis is a star, she's just not an intergalactic queen. And Channing Tatum's doggyness was plain silly.
Entourage: Movie based on TV show turns out like that TV show, everyone gets mad? That makes no sense to me, and I'm no Entourage fan, but there was nothing worse about this movie than its source material.
Vacation: This movie made me laugh out loud at least 20 times, and the Tartan Prancer is my favorite comedic character of the year. 
By the Sea: Angelina Jolie's attempt at an arthouse film is gorgeous and weird. Angelina Jolie is gorgeous and weird. That's just math.
Definitely as bad as advertised
Tomorrowland: Ugh.Terminator: Genisys: Ugh.Pixels: UGH.Fantastic Four: Oof.American Ultra: Seriously.
So bad that it gets its own category
Pan: ""So resoundingly awful that you have to see it.""
*Disclosure: I have yet to see these films, which fell on many critics' Top 10 lists: Brooklyn, Diary of a Teenage Girl, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Sicario, Trumbo, Joy.

5,The Associated Press,[],1100,"Munich train stations reopened and trains were running on New Year's Day, but a warning about Islamic State extremists intending to blow themselves up in the German city remained in place.
""The information about an imminent terror attack at midnight was very concrete,"" police spokeswoman Elisabeth Matzinger told The Associated Press on Friday. ""Even though nothing happened, our terror warning stays in place.""

Just shortly before the city rang in the new year, Munich police had evacuated the main train station and a station in the Pasing neighborhood. Partygoers were asked to avoid crowds.

The terror alert level in the southern German city of Munich remains high.Image: Sven Hoppe/picture-alliance/dpa/Associated PressAt a Friday news conference, Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said a friendly foreign intelligence service had warned Germany of an imminent attack at midnight by between five and seven Islamic State militants from Syria and Iraq planning to blow themselves up at locations in Munich, including the two stations.
Authorities were investigating intensively on Friday, Herrmann said, but so far had not made any arrests. He said they had received personal data for some of the attackers and were still in the process of investigating and verifying the information. He would not give any further details on the possible attackers.
Herrmann called on Munich residents to be cautious, but at the same time not to let the warning interfere with their normal lives.

Members of the German police cordon off an entrance to the central railway station.Image: Sven Hoppe/picture-alliance/dpa/Associated PressMore than 500 police and special unit officers from all over the southern Bavaria region were called to Munich late Friday night to help evacuate and secure the stations. Friday noon, some 100 extra officers were still present in the city.
Herrmann asked Munich residents for understanding that police would conduct more ID checks than usual.
German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere thanked all involved authorities for their ""thoughtful, considerate and decisive"" action in Munich on New Year's Eve.
""The situation in Europe and Germany continues to be serious in the new year,"" de Maiziere said. ""Indeed we did get indications (for a planned attack) yesterday, which were evaluated by the Bavarian intelligence authorities and federal police.""
De Maiziere promised that in the future, German security officials would continue to analyze the situation thoroughly and act accordingly.
Despite police warnings to stay away from big crowds, thousands of people were on the streets of Munich at midnight to welcome the new year with fireworks.
Cities across Europe have been on edge since an attack in Paris in November that killed 130 people.
A few days after the Paris attack, a soccer stadium in Hannover in central Germany was evacuated after a threat against a friendly match between Germany and the Netherlands. The authorities never reported any findings of explosives or concrete attack plans.

6,Josh Dickey,http://mashable.com/people/joshdickey/,3100,"LOS ANGELES — Natalie Cole, the accomplished R&B and pop singer who won a Grammy for her 1991 album of duets with her late father, Nat ""King"" Cole, has died, Mashable has confirmed. She was 65.
Cole, who battled through health problems in recent years, died of complications from ongoing health issues. She passed away late Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to a family statement.
""Unforgettable ... With Love"" won six Grammy Awards, including album of the year, record and song. Nat ""King"" Cole had died some 25 years earlier, of lung cancer, when Natalie was just 15.

""Natalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived ... with dignity, strength and honor. Our beloved Mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain UNFORGETTABLE in our hearts forever,"" read the statement from her son Robert Yancy and sisters Timolin and Casey Cole.
Cole caught the music bug from her father, and auditioned to sing with him when she was 11. Cole's early success came in the mid-1970s with R&B hits like ""This Will Be,"" ""Inseparable"" and ""Our Love."" The music industry welcomed her with two Grammy awards in 1976 — one for best new artist and one for best female R&B vocal performance for her buoyant hit ""This Will Be.""
But she re-emerged in the '90s as more of a pop and smooth-jazz artist like her father, finding her biggest success with the duets record, which sold 14 million copies.
She also worked as an actress, with appearances on TV's Touched by an Angel and Grey's Anatomy. But she was happiest touring and performing live.
""I still love recording and still love the stage,"" she said on her website in 2008, ""but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.""

She became an anti-drug advocate later in life after battling addiction to heroin and cocaine early in her career, entering rehab in 1983. Complications for hepatitis C forced her to undergo a kidney transplant in 2009.
The organ procurement agency One Legacy facilitated the donation from a family that had requested that their donor's organ go to Cole if it was a match.
Cole toured through much of her illness, often receiving dialysis at hospitals around the globe.
""I think that I am a walking testimony to you can have scars,"" she told People magazine. ""You can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.""
The Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.

7,Colin  Daileda,http://mashable.com/people/colin-daileda/,1800,"Camille Cosby will likely have to testify in a defamation suit against her husband, the famed comedian Bill Cosby, who is accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women over several decades. 
A Massachusetts judge denied Camille's motion on Dec. 31 to sidestep testifying against her husband in a case brought against him by seven women. The women say the comedian sexually assaulted them and then called them liars when they went public with their accusations. 
See also: Why a Bill Cosby accuser is getting a second chance at a trial 12 years later
Camille is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 6, though her lawyers are likely to appeal the decision. 
Her lawyers challenged the initial deposition by saying that Camille's conversations with her husband are private and not to be aired in court. 
But Camille also worked as her husband's business manager, a much more public aspect of their relationship. 
The privacy of spousal conversations is generally protected by law. And while Massachusetts Judge David Hennessy said that those privacy concerns are important, in this case, he said they ""do not outweigh the potential significance of Mrs. Cosby's testimony"" due to Camille's ""dual role as defendants' wife and business manager.""
The judge's decision in Massachusetts is the second significant legal blow to the Cosbys this week. 
Bill Cosby was charged with aggravated indecent assault in a separate case in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. He is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who used to work at Temple University, back in 2004. 
He was released on $1 million bail. If convicted, Cosby faces up to a decade behind bars.

8,The Associated Press,[],1400,"Though in the final year of his presidency, President Barack Obama is continuing to break personal ground by visiting a U.S. mosque for the first time in his presidency. 
Obama plans to visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday to meet with leaders of the local Muslim community. 
See also: Obama just gave his best immigration speech — and you probably missed it
The visit will amount to a public embrace of Muslims by Obama at a time when political discourse against them seems to be growing in some quarters, largely fueled by fears of terrorist acts carried out by extremist groups. The White House said he will go to the Baltimore mosque to ""celebrate the contributions Muslim Americans make to our nation and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom to our way of life.""
In remarks to be delivered at the mosque, Obama ""will reiterate the importance of staying true to our core values: welcoming our fellow Americans, speaking out against bigotry, rejecting indifference and protecting our nation's tradition of religious freedom,"" the White House said.

overwhelming majority of americans understand of diversity and religious pluralism is one of our greatest strengths https://t.co/AM1JLoA1TI
— President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016


so we all need to speak out against bias and stereotypes, to protect the freedom of others, and our own as well.
— President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016

Obama has been outspoken in pushing back against calls by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and others to block Muslims from being admitted to the U.S. over fears of domestic terrorism linked to radical extremist groups.
Others have cited potential security risks in pushing legislation in Congress to limit the resettlement of refugees from Iraq and Syria, where the Islamic State group is active and from which it has exported its brand of terrorism to other regions of the world.
It was a topic Obama addressed in his final State of the Union address a few weeks ago, saying:
That’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.” When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer. That’s not telling it like it is. It’s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.



""That’s not telling it like it is.""http://on.mash.to/1SNJfE8
Posted by Mashable News on Tuesday, January 12, 2016

Obama has argued that such efforts are wrong and serve only to incite extremist groups, weaken America's leadership around the world and put U.S. security at risk.
""We're not going to build progress with a bunch of phony tough talk, and bluster, and over-the-top claims that just play into ISIL's hands,"" the president said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. He spoke to House Democrats on Thursday as they strategized at a meeting in Baltimore. ""We're not going to strengthen our leadership around the world by allowing politicians to insult Muslims or pit groups of Americans against each other. That's not who we are.

Djokovic's six Australian Open wins in six finals complete a perfect streak for the Serbian, who equals Roy Emerson's record. Kerber claims her first ever title, and is the first German to do so since Steffi Graf in 1999. The Australian Open is the first tournament on a long road for many players, as it is the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments in the year. 
So as we farewell the Australian Open, here is a look back the finest photos from the past 10 years. The classics include a miraculous flying shot from Frenchman Gael Monfils this year, celebrations from former winners including Serena Williams, and legends like Roger Federer taking their best shot in Melbourne's summer heat.

10,Marcus Gilmer,http://mashable.com/people/marcusgilmer/,51600,"The Internet can often be a cold, dark place. But there are instances when a story strikes such a chord with online audiences that a community can coalesce around a subject for the greater good. 
Retiring Marietta, Ohio police officer Matthew Hickey and his K9 partner, Ajax, are discovering how wonderful that can be. 
See also: Over 100 police dogs walk in procession to honor fallen comrade
As Hickey planned to retire, he had assumed that Ajax would come to live with him. Ajax has lived with Hickey for the last three years and the retired officer considers the dog ""a family member"" in addition to the dog's role on the police force.  
“There is a bond between us and it’s very special and I would hate to lose my buddy,” Hickey told WTAP.
But there's a catch: according to city law, Ajax is property of the city of Marietta. And Ohio state law says, ""A law enforcement officer who leaves an equine or canine unit of a law enforcement agency while the police dog or horse assigned to the officer is still fit for duty forfeits the right to purchase the animal under this section.""
Hickey found out when his chief rejected his offer to purchase Ajax, telling WTAP, “I had the money for the dog and was ready to hand it to the the chief of police, and the chief of police said he couldn’t take it.""

— CBS Newspath (@cbsnewspath) January 31, 2016

Ajax is six years old and considered fit for active duty for several more years. Even though Hickey offered to pay the city to keep the dog — the city says Ajax is worth $3,500 — city law dictates that the dog must be sold at auction, though the auction is limited to only active and retired police and any officially sanctioned K9 trainers. 
Marietta Law Director Paul Betram III told WBNS, “The dog is property of the city of Marietta. Because it is personal property, it is treated like a shovel. That's just the way it is.”
And that's where the Internet stepped in. A Change.org petition collected over 22,000 signatures and Facebook users took to the city of Marietta's page to express their displeasure with the law.

But then the collective of supporters decided to channel their rage more productively. Rather than let Hickey have to sweat out the possibility of being outbid, a GoFundMe page has raised over $50,000 in less than a week to go towards Hickey's purchase of Ajax at auction. The auction date has yet to be set, but should be announced on Thursday, February 4th. 

Assuming no one tries to outbid Hickey for Ajax (and, really, who would be so cold?), the remaining money is to be spent on protective vests for K9 units, a growing trend in light of recent law enforcement incidents. 
A GoFundMe campaign recently raised more than $37,000 for police dog vests in Canton, Ohio following the recent death of K9 Jethro who was killed in the line of duty on January 9. And CNN's Anderson Cooper made a similar gesture following the death of another K9 in Virginia. 
The vests will probably continue to be an ongoing topic following Sunday's stabbing death of a K9 officer in the line of duty near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

11,Christina Warren,http://mashable.com/people/christina/,768,"As the battle between Apple and the FBI heats up over encryption, it's increasingly clear this isn't just about one iPhone.
A New York Times article on Saturday reported that the Department of Justice is worried about the encryption on apps such as WhatsApp.
See also: Apple calls DOJ's most recent response to San Bernardino case 'a cheap shot'
According to The Times, the encryption built into WhatsApp has stymied Justice Department attempts at wiretapping. Even with a judge's wiretap order, WhatsApp's encryption prevents law enforcement from reading or intercepting messages sent on its platform.
This is a problem for the Department of Justice, and it's one without a clear solution. A court could order WhatsApp — which is owned by Facebook — to comply with wiretap orders, but it would face technical and legal challenges. 
The problem, at least for the Justice Department, may only be getting tougher.
The Guardian reported on Monday that Facebook, Google and Snapchat are all working to increase their own encryption and privacy in the wake of the Apple vs. FBI showdown.
According to The Guardian, WhatsApp plans on adding encryption to its voice calls in a few weeks. The Guardian says Facebook is also looking at increasing the encryption used for Facebook Messenger.
Snapchat is reportedly also at creating more secure messages, though let's be clear: Snapchat hardly has the best track record with securing user data. Google too is said to be looking at ways use its encryption technology in more places.
Tech companies getting serious about encryption
Last week, Medium's Steven Levy wrote an extraordinary piece chronicling the Crypto Wars from the '90s. Two decades ago, law enforcement and technologists battled over the ideas of encryption.
For a time, it looked like cryptography won, with the Clinton administration basically accepting that for the digital revolution to happen, it would have to happen with crypto.
Standards such as AES-128 (and, later, AES-256), SSL and public keys became part of the tech lexicon and the modern computer security industry was born.
Still, as Levy writes, winning the war doesn't mean everything has been great for consumers (emphasis added):
But here's something that didn't happen: a strong crypto infrastructure that protected our information and privacy. The fact is that while the security industry has boomed, our information really isn't much safer than it was when we were fighting the first crypto war. This is because the tech world has been slow to build strong encryption into our systems as a default. It's been too hard to use, and all too often businesses and institutions don't even take obvious steps to secure data. Chronic lapses in our communications software and disasters happen on almost a daily basis. ...We simply haven't used our capabilities to make our electrical grids, our credit card systems, and our ISPs bulletproof. As a result, the public has not fully reaped the spoils from winning that first crypto war. 
But slowly but surely, that has been changing. Maybe it's the public realization that so much of our data is now stored on the cloud. Or perhaps it's the increase in hacks that leave private information vulnerable.
Whatever the reason, even before the most recent Apple vs. FBI nonsense, we've seen tech companies start to get more serious about building better encryption into their products.
If companies want consumers to trust them with their data, they increasingly have to prove that they are capable of protecting that data. And that's possible with encryption.
Which of course, is the big rub for law enforcement.
Two decades ago, the government agreed that the promises of the Clipper Chip — a chip that was designed to protect communications except if there was a government request for access — were simply infeasible (the Clipper Chip project was dropped in 1996 after its encryption technology was hacked). Today, it does seem that we're having similar conversations, although the stakes are different.
On the most recent episode of the HBO show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver does an admirable job dissecting the latest conversation about encryption. It's worth watching.
 
What's next
If Google, Facebook, Snapachat, Apple and other companies do continue to add better encryption to their platforms by default — and it seems like that is absolutely going to happen — we're going to have to have a much broader discussion in Congress about encryption and its role.
There aren't easy answers, and in a perfect world there could be concessions both sides make that balance the underlying challenges of personal information security versus homeland security.
But for now, it will be interesting to see how law enforcement handles the reality that the tools we use to communicate are going to be more and more difficult to intercept.

12,Karissa Bell,http://mashable.com/people/karissabe/,3800,"If you're still painstakingly killing all your apps in the hopes of squeezing out some extra battery life from your iPhone, you can officially stop.
Apple's iOS chief Craig Federighi has dispelled the myth that force closing your iPhone apps will help save your battery. The executive confirmed that killing apps isn't necessary for your battery and said that he is not in the habit of closing his apps.
See also: How to use Low Power Mode on the iPhone to save battery life
Federighi, who oversees iOS and OS X, was responding to an email sent by an Apple customer to CEO Tim Cook when he made the comments. In the email, which was first published by 9to5Mac, the customer asked Cook, ""do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary of battery life?""
Though the note, dated March 6, was sent to Cook, Federighi weighed in the next day with a simple answer. ""No and no,"" he wrote. (You can see the full email exchange here.)
This is far from the first time this particular myth has been debunked. Apple's own support page even states that ""generally, there's no need to force an app to close unless it's unresponsive.""
That's because, as 9to5Mac and others have pointed out, most of the apps that appear in the multitasking view when you double press the home button aren't actually running in the background. From Apple:
After you switch to a different app, some apps run for a short period of time before they're set to a suspended state. Apps that are in a suspended state aren’t actively in use, open, or taking up system resources
Of course, it's always a good idea to check your app settings every once in awhile to make sure that the apps that are using your location actually need it — as location services tend to use up the most battery. Also,  disabling background refresh on apps you don't use very much is a good idea. Some apps, like Facebook's, may be worse offenders at sucking your battery dry than others.

14,Adam Rosenberg,http://mashable.com/people/adamrosenberg/,709,"Is Just Cause 3 a cry for help?
There's a mission during the game's third act that so closely resembles an earlier pair from the first two acts that the back-and-forth dialogue lapses into a sort of self-aware fatigue.
See also: 'Futurama' will live on — as a mobile game, at least
To paraphrase: ""Oh, we're doing this again."" ""Yup. Follow the trail of pipes and shoot all the things, then blow up the three big things and escape. You've done this before, you're good."" ""Gotcha.""
Nothing exists in a video game without its creators consciously putting it there. People built this series of three missions, saw how mindlessly similar they were and wrote a script calling that out. It's like the team at Avalanche Studios knew their game had issues, and is surreptitiously apologizing.

Image: Avalanche StudiosIt's not a total loss. Just Cause 3 gives good sandbox. Great sandbox, even. The simple act of running and jumping and grappling and parachuting and wingsuiting and blowing stuff up and— okay, it's not simple. The learning curve ascends to great heights very quickly.
Expect to spend several hours faceplanting into cliffs, rocky outcroppings and completely flat surfaces before you get the hang of transitioning between your three main movement tools: the grapple, the parachute and the wingsuit. There's a lot of frustration as you grow accustomed to the feel of things, but it's a mountain worth climbing for fans of chaos.
""Chaos"" is the point system that rules the game, a meaningless score that measures the destruction you've sown across the many islands making up the fictional Republic of Medici. The higher your score, the more stuff you've destroyed.
Just Cause 3 is riddled with numerical ladder climbs like this, though the more meaningful ones measure your progress against your friends and a global leaderboard. As you fly around in a wingsuit, or score consecutive headshots, or perform any number of other invisibly tracked actions, miniature pop-ups show you how you rank alongside other players.
""What's that, game? If I fly around for another 30 seconds without touching the ground, I'll beat my friend's score? Maybe I won't start this mission just yet....""
In a game that too often struggles to find its voice, climbing numerical ladders in an endless quest to one-up your friends is a major motivator. Moving and shooting is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it, but leaderboards give purpose to your mayhem.

Image: Avalanche StudiosThe problems spring up when you dive into anything more structured.
Take the story. It's incomprehensible. Character introductions seem to assume that players know who these people are from past games. That familiarity is unearned, making it hard to follow what's going on beyond the basic ""evil dictator = bad guy"" conceit.
There's also not much reason to figure things out. At best, story missions are rote exercises that do very little to make the core gameplay more interesting than it often is when you're causing trouble in the open world. More often than not, you're defending something or fighting off waves of attackers. Each story act concludes with a lengthy traipse through smaller battles, in which the goal is literally: kill all the red blips.
Separate from the story are Challenges, a collection of minigames that test your skills in a variety of disciplines. One asks you to fly your wingsuit through a series of rings. In another, you have to keep an explosives-packed vehicle above a certain speed as you steer it into a distant group of enemies.
Do well in these Challenges and you earn ""Gears,"" which unlock upgrades. There's just one problem: None of the minigames evolve enough over time to make climbing the upgrade tree an enjoyable process. The islands of Medici are visually rich with different terrains, but the beauty of it all never hides the fact that you're performing the same task on repeat.
The dullness that pervades both the story and the upgrade process falls into the background once you get the hang of exploration and sowing destruction. Just Cause 3 turns into a different game as you venture out into the world and reclaim territory from the Bad Guy Evil Dictator with no real direction save for the one you set yourself.
This can result in some weird inconsistencies on the story side, such as when you have to infiltrate a base or town that your rebel forces already control. But who cares? Blowing stuff up in creative ways is the best Just Cause 3 has to offer.
It's truly thrilling to fly across the world using nothing more than a grappling hook, a parachute and a wingsuit, only to then land, plant some C4 (from your infinite supply) and grapple away as everything explodes behind you.

Image: Avalanche StudiosThose skyscraping highs turn Just Cause 3 into its own worst enemy. There's nothing in the game that compares to the absolute freedom of exploring and destroying its wide open world. As great as those moments are, there's not enough video game here to support them.
So I ask again: Is Just Cause 3 a cry for help? Is it an object lesson in the creative well running dry? Or is there more that happened behind the scenes to explain how this weird mix of mechanical perfection and design disaster came to exist?

Just Cause 3


The Good
Massive, environmentally varied open world • Wingsuit injects fresh thrills into a series lauded for its movement • Creative destruction is a lot of fun
The Bad
The story feels disjointed • Challenges turn the upgrade grind into an unpleasant chore
The Bottom Line
Just Cause 3 nails the basics, but fails to build a competent video game around that foundation.

15,Jessica Plautz,http://mashable.com/people/jessicaplautz/,875,"Since the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, hotels in the city have seen occupancy rates drop as much as 30%. Flight reservations are down 27%.
A government estimate of the damage to France's economy tops $2 billion.
With images of the attacks and a militarized response circulating the globe, the sharp drops are not surprising — but Paris depends on tourists. And the appearance of turmoil following the deadly attacks can continue to do economic damage, even as the city returns to normalcy.
The tourism industry employs some 260,000 people in the city, or 20% of the full-time workforce: Visitors spent $17 billion in Paris in 2014. In all of France, tourism represents nearly 10% of GDP, supporting almost 3 million jobs. Which is why, amid mourning and the political response to the threat of the Islamic State, tourism industry leaders met with French Prime Minister Manual Valls last week to discuss how to approach the holiday season.
Government officials, the hotel industry, airlines, restaurants, shops and tour agents all face the same challenge of convincing the world that France is still the top international destination. Fortunately for the city, there are already some indicators that the tourism industry is getting back on track.
There have been some positive signs for the industry amid the tragedy: Gavin Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar Tours, told Mashable that a near majority of the tour agency's customers did not cancel booked trips in response to the attacks.
""Those who had made their decisions (to travel to France) maintained them,"" he said. ""But what we did see was the impact on future bookings.""
Looking ahead
Large companies have some flexibility to ride out the downturn.
“Parisian hoteliers should be reaching out to guests, rethinking their strategy in source markets, looking at new demand opportunities and saying that the city is not defined by this one act,” said Elizabeth Winkle, managing director of STR Global, in Hotel News Now.
For small companies, however, a bad season can do a lot of damage: Prodiss, the union for French show producers, reported an 80% drop in ticket sales compared to the same period last year.
For hotels, the drop in interest could save undeterred travelers some money. There are plenty of deals to be found for December and January travel dates.

Travel-information company Forward Data SL said bookings to Paris over the Christmas holiday were down 13% compared with last year since the Nov. 13 attacks.
Forward Data CEO Olivier Jager said in an interview that the company reviewed bookings data that it buys from ticket information distribution systems used by 200,000 travel agencies. The information does not include trips booked directly with the airlines, which is roughly half of all tickets.
Airfare data company Hopper saw a spike in searches for U.S.-to-Paris flights right after the attacks, followed by a drop that puts interest significantly lower than last year.

Image: Hopper""I suspect the initial spike is due to many people with future Paris travel plans checking on their options to change/cancel,"" Hopper's Chief Data Scientist Patrick Surry said, ""and then demand tapered off as fewer people look to plan future travel there.""
As for airfare, prices have mostly held steady both for trips originating in the U.S. and in Paris, according to Hopper's data.

""I've heard it countless times, if we give in to terrorism, and change our lives, we are actually allowing them to win,"" said Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar.
Although he considers the attacks ""transformational"" for international travel, he's hopeful that giving people the facts will return tourism to normal levels.
""It's important that the world sees that Europe is open,"" he said.

16,Ariel Bogle,http://mashable.com/people/ariel-bogle/,1600,"Although Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has so far struck a conciliatory tone at the U.N. Climate Summit in Paris, known as COP21, he broke with other world leaders Tuesday by refusing to sign a pledge phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.
Under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who once declared coal is ""good for humanity,"" Australia walked back many of its climate change commitments, including abandoning a carbon trading scheme. 
Turnbull, who addressed COP21 on Monday local time, has reemphasised the country's appetite for combatting global warming, but environmental advocates are watching Australia's new prime minister closely as he attends the landmark talks in Paris.
See also: Latest updates: Paris climate talks
The COP21 communiqué aimed to eliminate inefficient subsidies for coal, gas and oil that keep prices artificially low.
The rejection of the fossil fuel pledge came after politicians from Australia's Nationals party, who tend to represent rural areas, lobbied against it, ABC News reported.
They were particularly concerned about the effect the pledge might have on the diesel fuel rebate for farmers and miners. In an ABC interview Tuesday, Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce said signing the statement would cause Australia to lose a significant amount of its agricultural export income. ""It would make sections of the agricultural industry unviable,"" he said. It's unclear if the pledge would have impacted the diesel fuel rebate.
On the ABC Tuesday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pointed out that at the G20 in 2009, Australia also signed a pledge to phase out ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.""
In his COP21 address, Turnbull said Australia would ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. He also pledged that the government would contribute at least A$1 billion (US$723 million) out of the aid budget over the next five years to build climate resilience among Pacific nations. ""Australia is not daunted by the challenge. With great optimism and faith in humanity’s genius for invention,"" he said.
Australia has also joined the U.S. and other countries in committing to double its clean energy investment as part of a new initiative, Mission Innovation.
The Australian government's current emissions reduction target is 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
Opposition leader Bill Shorten, whose Labor Party has a policy of a 45% reduction in pollution by 2030, told reporters Tuesday that despite Turnbull's rhetoric, he is still following the ineffective climate policies laid down by Abbott. ""We don't see Australia taking climate change as seriously as other countries,"" he said.

17,Jessica Plautz,http://mashable.com/people/jessicaplautz/,875,"Since the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, hotels in the city have seen occupancy rates drop as much as 30%. Flight reservations are down 27%.
A government estimate of the damage to France's economy tops $2 billion.
With images of the attacks and a militarized response circulating the globe, the sharp drops are not surprising — but Paris depends on tourists. And the appearance of turmoil following the deadly attacks can continue to do economic damage, even as the city returns to normalcy.
The tourism industry employs some 260,000 people in the city, or 20% of the full-time workforce: Visitors spent $17 billion in Paris in 2014. In all of France, tourism represents nearly 10% of GDP, supporting almost 3 million jobs. Which is why, amid mourning and the political response to the threat of the Islamic State, tourism industry leaders met with French Prime Minister Manual Valls last week to discuss how to approach the holiday season.
Government officials, the hotel industry, airlines, restaurants, shops and tour agents all face the same challenge of convincing the world that France is still the top international destination. Fortunately for the city, there are already some indicators that the tourism industry is getting back on track.
There have been some positive signs for the industry amid the tragedy: Gavin Tollman, CEO of Trafalgar Tours, told Mashable that a near majority of the tour agency's customers did not cancel booked trips in response to the attacks.
""Those who had made their decisions (to travel to France) maintained them,"" he said. ""But what we did see was the impact on future bookings.""
Looking ahead
Large companies have some flexibility to ride out the downturn.
“Parisian hoteliers should be reaching out to guests, rethinking their strategy in source markets, looking at new demand opportunities and saying that the city is not defined by this one act,” said Elizabeth Winkle, managing director of STR Global, in Hotel News Now.
For small companies, however, a bad season can do a lot of damage: Prodiss, the union for French show producers, reported an 80% drop in ticket sales compared to the same period last year.

18,The Associated Press,[],983,"SEOUL, South Korea — Samsung appointed a new mobile president at Samsung Electronics for the first time in six years after growth stalled at the world's largest smartphone maker.
The Samsung Group conglomerate said Tuesday that Dongjin Koh was promoted to president. He will replace Shin Jong-kyun as the head of the mobile business at its flagship company Samsung Electronics starting next year. The change was announced as part of annual management reshuffle at South Korea's top conglomerate.

Samsung Electronics' smartphone sales lead has been dwindling in the face of competition from Apple Inc. in the premium market and Chinese companies in cheaper devices. The management change comes as Lee Jae-yong, the only son of ailing Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, takes a bigger role in Samsung after his father suffered a heart attack in May last year.
Shin will step away from day-to-day operations and focus on long-term strategies. He keeps his title of CEO of the IT and mobile division that encompasses phone, network and computer businesses.
Koh, an engineer, was an executive vice president who led mobile research and development for the past year.
The 54-year-old has followed the typical career path of those who reach senior executive levels in South Korea: he joined Samsung Electronics in 1984 and over three decades worked his way through its development, human resources, product planning and research departments.
Samsung said he led the development of two flagship smartphones released this year, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. He was also behind development of the Samsung Pay mobile payments system.
Shin became the head of mobile in 2010. Three years later, Samsung was the world largest smartphone supplier despite being a latecomer behind Apple.
But in the past year, Samsung's global smartphone market share has dwindled to less than one quarter and its quarterly mobile profit shrank to less than half of its best quarters.

20,Sarah Spigelman Richter,http://mashable.com/people/sarah-spigelman-richter/,2800,"The 7-Eleven convenience store chain may have started in the U.S. but its international presence serves a variety of cultural tastes and traditions. What the store offers depends less on its moniker and much more on its location. 
When Joe Thompson opened the first outlet of what would become 7-Eleven in Dallas, Texas in 1927, it operated out of Southland Ice Company's ice dock and sold milk, eggs and bread. The goal was to let customers quickly and easily get these daily items without having to go through the hassle of getting to or navigating a traditional grocery store. 
The idea worked and more locations opened. 
The stores became known as ""Tote'm Stores,"" because customers toted away purchases. The name was changed to 7-Eleven in 1946 to reflect the company's new seven a.m. to 11 p.m. schedule. 
See also: China's street food vendors are creating edible works of art

A 1950s era 7-Eleven.Image: Flickr, Roadside PicturesAt the time, these late hours were unheard of and put 7-Eleven on the map. 
Now there are 56,600 franchises worldwide, making 7-Eleven the world's largest convenience store chain. The chain made its Asian debut in Taiwan in 1979 and from there expanded to many Asian countries over the next three decades and counting.
The brand may be global, but its services and products vastly differ according to locale. 
In the U.S., it's still a place to pick up essentials and snacks — it's convenient and inexpensive. Customers pop in for tissues, a six-pack of beer and maybe a bag of potato chips. Some 7-Elevens have attached gas stations, and act as unofficial rest stops on road trips. 


A photo posted by aziz x (@azizxthegod) on Nov 23, 2015 at 9:34am PST

It's certainly not typically seen as a dining destination — at least not by Americans. 
By contrast, many convenience stores in Asia have little in common with their American counterparts. They are places to socialize, to spend time in, and are bonafide foodie destinations in their own right. 

In, Taiwan, many 7-Elevens offer dry cleaning. In Indonesia, some are  cool hangouts where people spend hours sipping coffee and chatting with friends. 
Why many Asian countries have embraced the full-service convenience store, the model is constantly evolving. One theory says these stores have, through modest pricing and an array of services and goods made themselves meeting points that reinforce community interaction. Another says the inviting environments, with outdoor seating and Internet connections, offer an oasis for millennials in crowded cities where space is at a premium. 
Food host and actor Lynn Chen tells Mashable 7-Elevens in Taiwan are ""more like community hubs where people hang out, do Internet, pick up a quick packaged dinner and actually sit down and eat. They sell everything from underwear to Christmas ornaments (in June!) to asparagus juice.""

To say nothing of the blood sausage, chicken-flavored Cheetos and tuna sandwich in a can. 
These might be everyday indulgences for people in Taiwan and other countries in Asia, but for a food lover who hasn't ever seen these treats before, it's a culinary goldmine.

Sausage finally gets the idolatry it deserves.

Image: 7-ElevenTarn Susumpow, Mashable production assistant who grew up in Thailand, says, ""When I was a kid coming home on the school bus, the bus would stop in front of 7-Eleven. All the kids could jump off and get Slurpees and sausages."" 
7-Elevens's selection includes sausages stuffed with bacon, German varieties and footlong versions chopped and served with ketchup or chili sauce. Just don't expect a bun when you get your sausage kick  — here, it's enjoyed au naturel. 
There was even a limited run web series called Sausage Mansion, which promoted 7-Eleven and its hot dog and sausage products. ""Thai 7-Eleven franchises are controlled by an agro-conglomerate called Charoen Pokphand, which also owns industrial pork farms and a cable TV provider,"" CNBC reported in 2012.  
Japan
Onigiri, where form meets function meets delicious


A photo posted by Mee Piyanat (@amenochikara) on Oct 15, 2015 at 7:45pm PDT

In Japanese food culture there is often an emphasis on making food beautiful or ""kawaii"" (cute). It's hard to get cuter than onigiri, triangular rice and nori (toasted seaweed) packets that are compact, wholesome and most importantly tasty. These are available all over Japan's 7-Elevens and come with fillings like salmon, cod roe, soy sauce and umeboshi (salty and piquant pickled plums). The coolest part might be the packaging, which keeps the crispy seaweed separate from the moist rice until you are ready to eat. 
The Kit Kat selection of your wildest dreams

The selection of Kit Kats (regular and special edition) you get at 7-Eleven is just astounding. Rum raisin, strawberry cheesecake, wasabi, sweet red bean paste, matcha, golden citrus blend and Annin dofu flavor are just a few of the flavored Kit-Kats available in many Asian countries. Forget breaking off a piece of a Kit Kat bar, you'll have to get an entirely new carryon bag to cart home your tasty souvenirs.

Cheap but elaborate traditional Korean meals

Image: 7-ElevenAn extensive Korean feast awaits you in a compact, partitioned container in any South Korean 7-Eleven. Instead of a tired ham and cheese sandwich, treats like galbi, bulgogi, kimchi, marinated seafood and seaweed salad await. Don't forget that steamed rice and hot miso soup to round out your meal. 
Winnie the Pooh-approved honey flavored treats

Ready-to-eat duck tongue

This ready-to-eat version in Hong Kong's 7-Eleven is marinated in citrus peel, cooking wine, superior pickle sauce and a slew of other ingredients. They can be enjoyed as is — just be careful to pluck out the tiny bone in the center before you gobble it whole.
China
A year's worth of incredibly flavored potato chips

Like the U.S., flavors in the store change constantly. It makes your local 7-Eleven's got Flamin' Hot Cheetos look really lame. For a chance of pace, too bad you can't drown your sorrows in a bag of crunchy hot and sour fish soup-flavored potato chips. 
These 7-Elevens might seem too far to enjoy, but don't pass them over on your next trip.  The nearest 7-Eleven might be the delicious and authentic spot you crave.

22,Emily Cahn,http://mashable.com/people/emily-cahn/,1100,"Yet another batch of emails from Hillary Clinton's personal email server were released Thursday afternoon.
The New Year's Eve news dump included more than 1,200 emails from the former secretary of state's personal email account, which dogged her campaign for the early part of her candidacy. 
The release now brings the total number of email pages made public to more than 40,000. That, however, did not meet the court-ordered mandate that the State Department release 43,000 pages by the end of the year. The State Department said it will release more emails next week to account for the missed deadline.
""We have worked diligently to come as close to the goal as possible, but with the large number of documents involved and the holiday schedule we have not met the goal this month,"" the department said in a release.
The dump of emails came at 4 p.m. EST on New Year's Eve, a time when Americans are unlikely to be reading the news.

Clinton's campaign says it was not up to them when to release the emails, and sought to deflect ""snark"" on the timing the day before the emails were released. Instead, the court order requires the State Department to release emails every 30 days.

Overall, many of the emails were heavily redacted, and provided little news to pull out. 
But the emails did reveal some insight about what life was like in Clinton's inner circle at the State Department. 
Here are three things to digest from Thursday's email dump:
Clinton was perplexed by the viral 'Texts from Hillary' meme
The image of Clinton using her blackberry on a plane while donning sunglasses has become an iconic photo, as well as a meme that launched the ""Texts from Hillary"" Tumblr account.
But when a State Department diplomat emailed to note the photo went viral, Clinton was perplexed.
""Why now?"" she responded. ""That was on way to Libya?""
Clinton's former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, assured her the photo was great.
""You look cute,"" Mills wrote.

Philippe Reines, one of Clinton's top advisers, was perturbed that none of his colleagues responded to what he thought was a hilarious flow-chart to determine who rode alongside Clinton on car rides. 
""I did NOT/NOT receive sufficient appreciation for the below,"" Reines wrote in an email. ""Only Jake reacted. It took HOURS to get the formatting right. Literally hours to ensure it would work on every size font. Without positive reinforcement I'm not sure I can continue to really invest myself in these missives/diatribes.""

At the bottom of a lengthy letter, in which he requested documents from his time at the State Department be declassified, Kissinger hand-wrote a line of praise.
“I greatly admire the skill and aplomb with which you conduct our foreign policy,"" Kissinger wrote in the Feb. 7, 2012, memo.

BEIJING — Police scuffled with protesters and journalists at a Beijing courthouse Monday as prominent rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang stood trial on charges of provoking trouble and stirring ethnic hatred with commentaries posted online that were critical of the ruling Communist Party.
Chinese protesters and foreign rights groups said Pu's trial at the No. 2 Beijing Intermediate Court amounted to political persecution, and foreign governments including the U.S. called for his release. The trial concluded about midday, and Pu's lawyer Shang Baojun said a verdict and sentence would be delivered at a later date.

While Pu was standing trial, authorities were allegedly clamping down on his supporters online and outside the courthouse. A Beijing-based user posted a number of screenshots from Weibo claiming to be from Chinese users of the service receiving warnings from the police for discussing Pu.
He added that several people who used pictures of Pu as their Weibo avatars also had the pictures deleted.

Speaking outside the courthouse while a policeman tried to grab him, activist Yang Qiuyu said: ""Pu Zhiqiang is a lawyer with a conscience. This is why he is now under arrest. We support him, and that means that we are also defending our own rights.""
Pu was active in defending free speech and represented dissident artist Ai Weiwei in a tax evasion case that Ai's supporters said was politically motivated. He also was instrumental in pushing for the eventual abolishment of the labor camp system, which allowed police to lock up people for up to four years without a trial.
About 50 protesters had gathered at the courthouse along with a couple dozen journalists and about a dozen Western diplomats, but all of them were denied entrance. Police and plainclothes security officers wearing yellow smiley-face stickers pushed journalists and protesters away from the court entrance area. They threw one of the protesters the ground and took away several others.

At least one foreign journalist also was slammed to the ground, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said in an open letter of complaint about the rough treatment.
The charges against Pu relate to a number of posts on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo that questioned the party's policies toward the Tibetan and Uighur ethnic minorities in the Tibet and Xinjiang regions, and mocked political figures.
Pu's other lawyer Mo Shaoping said prosecutors had not demonstrated that any of Pu's postings had provoked troubles or incited ethnic tensions.
""This is really a case of freedom of expression, in which no harm to anyone has been proven,"" Mo said in an interview after the trial. Pu's lawyers asked for bail, arguing that he was no danger to the public and had medical ailments that needed attention.

Pu was detained shortly after attending a May 2014 meeting to discuss commemorating 25 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, at a time when authorities were keeping a lid on any public commemorations of the event. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of protesters were killed, and the topic remains taboo in China.

Dan Biers, a diplomat with the US embassy, told reporters outside the courthouse that the U.S. urges Chinese authorities to release Pu and uphold the Chinese constitution.
""Lawyers and civil society leaders such as Mr. Pu should not be subject to continued repression but should be allowed to contribute to the building of a prosperous and stable society,"" Biers said, reading from a statement.
Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International, called Pu's trial an act of political persecution. ""He is being punished solely for standing up to the Chinese government in his courageous defense of human rights,"" he said.
Amnesty International says there have been ""repeated procedural irregularities"" in his prosecution, including a prolonged pre-trial detention, denial of adequate medical care and prosecutors refusing to disclose evidence against him to his defense lawyers.

25,Raymond Wong,http://mashable.com/people/raymond-wong/,3200,"Battery cases — ""smart"" or not — are for suckers and only highlight a modern smartphone's inability to last through an entire day without needing to be recharged. 
Until we get a real battery breakthrough, cramming a bigger battery into a phone is the next best thing. That's exactly what the Oukitel K10000 phone packs. Whereas most smartphone batteries store between 1,500-3,000 milliamp-hours (mAh), the K10000 has a 10,000 mAh battery — good for 10 to 15 days according to a report from The Techolic.
See also: The 6 best iPhone apps for travelers of all time
The K10000's big battery is also good for charging other devices. That's right, it works like a battery pack and can recharge an iPhone 6S Plus up to three times.
Other than the unusually large battery, the K10000 is a pretty average smartphone running Android 5.1 Lollipop. It has a 5.5-inch screen with 720p resolution (1,280 x 720), a 1GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD card). It also supports dual SIM cards.
On the back is an 8-megapixel camera with LED flash, and the front camera is 2 megapixels. Nothing special.
Impressive as the K10000's battery life sounds, we have to sour things a bit. At best, a phone with a 3,000 mAh battery is good for around 1.5 days. Extrapolating on that data that we've seen time and again from our Android phone reviews over the years, the K10000 will probably only last up to about five days of ""normal"" smartphone use consisting of web browsing, texting, video playback and light gaming, which is still significantly longer than most phones.
It's more likely the 10-15 day battery life is referring to talk time, and who really talks anymore on their phones? Of course, it's possible the phone can last up to 15 days if you simply don't use it very often.
The K10000 is available for from Gearbeast for $239.99 and ships on Jan. 2.

Nissan is not afraid to give credit where credit is due.
As the Japanese automaker looks to stake out a bigger claim to the pickup truck market with its super-sized new Titan XD model, it's taking the unusual step of tipping a hat to its more established, dominant American rivals in its advertising.
In a dramatic new 90-second commercial spot called ""Shoulders of Giants"" that debuted during the National Football Championship on Monday night, Nissan seems to admit that its new truck would not be possible without the ground already broken by Detroit's Big Three. 
See also: Microsoft employees serenade Apple employees for 'peace on earth'
""To those who go before us — Chevy, Ford, Dodge. Thank you,"" the narrator says over shots of one particularly innovative model from each brand. ""We see the way forward."" 
That homage follows an emotional montage of caring parents, heroic firefighters and an impassioned football coach motivating a player — all ostensibly meant as analogies of Nissan's relationship with its competitors.
Of course, there's a competitive edge to the ad as well. You don't figuratively stand on the shoulders of giants — a reference of course to an iconic quote made famous by Isaac Newton — unless you intend to surpass what they've done, and Nissan seems to be positioning its new Titan XD as the next big breakthrough that will render the best models of each of the American manufacturers things of the past.
But Nissan insists that the shoutout was not a backhanded compliment — though it's up to the viewers to ultimately decide — and that it was legitimately attempting to pay respects to fellow auto brands. 
The fact that Nissan is lining its trucks up against Detroit's is ambitious in its own right. The Big Three have long locked down the U.S. market for pickups and Nissan currently only sports a one-percent sliver of a share.

28,The Associated Press,[],2200,"A survivor hidden in a tree says he watched Boko Haram extremists firebomb huts and heard the screams of children among people burned to death in the latest attack by Nigeria's homegrown Islamic extremists.
Scores of charred corpses and bodies with bullet wounds littered the streets from Saturday night's attack on Dalori village just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the biggest city in the northeast, according to survivors and soldiers.
See also: ISIS isn't the world’s deadliest terrorist group. Boko Haram is.
The shooting and burning continued for four hours, survivor Alamin Bakura said, weeping on a telephone call to The Associated Press. He said several of his family members were killed or wounded.
The violence continued as three female suicide bombers blew up among people who managed to flee to neighboring Gamori village, killing many people, according to a soldier at the scene who insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to journalists.
It was not known how many scores of people were killed because bodies still were being collected, including from the surrounding bushes where the insurgents hunted down fleeing villagers, according to Abba Shehu, a security guard helping collect corpses.
Boko Haram has taken to attacking soft targets, increasingly with suicide bombers, since the military last year drove them out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria.
The 6-year Islamic uprising has killed about 20,000 people and driven 2.5 million from their homes.

29,Heather Dockray,http://mashable.com/people/heather-dockray/,2400,"Louis C.K. loves nothing more than a good, quality understatement.
The artist who somehow made loose-fit jeans popular again recently dropped a brand new series on his website Saturday morning. 
See also: Louis CK has a logical explanation for why he's waiting to do more 'Louie'
In August, Louie announced that he'd be taking a break from his own show to work on some new projects. But viewers had no idea what was coming, until he sent out a simple email on Saturday morning announcing the show's release.
""Hi there. Horace and Pete episode one is available for download. $5. Go here to watch it. We hope you like it. Regards, Louis,"" the comedian wrote.
God Louie, you're such a self-promoter. Calm down!

Image: HoraceandpeteTitled Horace and Pete, the very dark comedy features comedic heavyweights Steve Buscemi, Aidy Bryant, Edie Falco and the artist himself. The series explores the lives of two slightly depressed Brooklyn bartenders running a — you guessed it — slightly depressed Brooklyn bar. 
The first 67-minute episode feels contemporary and topical, with conversations ranging from Super Bowl quarterbacks to Donald Trump. 
While Horace and Pete is a dramedy, unlike Louie, the story is structured more like a dark drama than a comedy.
The first episode is currently available for purchase for $5 on Louis' site.

Los Angeles artist Andrew Tarusov has always been a fan of Disney movies and Tim Burton creations. And while many of these movies are geared towards children, Edward Scissorhands is about as far from Aladdin's Jasmine as you can get (though they BOTH have great hair).
See also: Why is the Internet obsessed with Disney princesses?
Recently, however, the artist decided to fuse the two genres and give a bunch of Disney characters a gothic makeover. Sure, Tim Burton and Walt Disney have *slightly* different outlooks on life, but the artists share a visual vocabulary. So Tarusov darkened the Disney palette, extended some limbs, and added some mascara. What we're left with is this:

31,Sonam Joshi,http://mashable.com/people/sonam-joshi/,1500,"As the threat of the Zika virus looms worldwide, India's Tata Motors is getting ready to launch a hatchback named Tata Zica. The name, a combination of the words ""zippy"" and ""car"", had been chosen long before its namesake virus hit the headlines.
See also: Zika virus is spreading 'explosively' and may be international health emergency, WHO warns
Tata is India's fifth largest automaker, and the owner of the British luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover. It is hoping to regain its market share in the country through the Zica, which will be launched during the forthcoming Indian Auto Expo this week. Designed by an international team, the small car has been received favourable reviews for its contemporary look and latest features. The company plans to follow its launch with a new line of passenger vehicles.

— Zica Tata Motors (@ZicaTataMotors) January 3, 2016

Unfortunately, its launch has coincided with the spread of the mosquito-born Zika virus, which results in birth defects such as microcephaly, or unusually small heads in babies. A few days ago, the World Health Organisation said that the virus was spreading ""explosively"" and may constitute a public health emergency.
While the virus hasn't spread to India yet, doctors have predicted that the country may be at risk. On social media, several users have wondered whether the similar-sounding names will impact the sales of the car. A company spokesperson has said that while the car's name will not be changed for the launch, it may be renamed in the future.

Oh God! Tata is thinking of launching Zica in February, and we have a virus by that name.

While the original mission was to make people look good, this time Guess wanted to focus on making people feel good as well.
""When designing this line, the idea was to keep it simple and create a collection of fashion-forward denim,"" a Guess representative  told Mashable. ""We had to ensure the styles weren’t too overdone since the fabric was to speak for itself.""
The brand combined a clean silhouette with a subtle indigo hue to keep the collection refined.
""Everyone owns a piece of denim. You can buy that anywhere,"" Guess told Mashable. ""But when you add something different that no one else has, such as ... denim that helps improve your body — that is something not many people can say no to.  Denim is forever evolving, and Guess wants to continue to be a pioneer in that market.""

33,Rachel Thompson,http://mashable.com/people/rachelthompson/,1100,"UPDATED: 3:00 p.m. GMT with Academy of Medical Sciences statement
LONDON — Scientists in the UK have been granted permission to genetically modify human embryos in a bid to gain a deeper understanding of the earliest moments of human life.
Following the green light from regulators Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), experiments could begin in the next few months, according to the BBC. However, scientists will not be allowed to implant the embryos into a woman.
The research — which will be undertaken at the Francis Crick Institute in London on embryos in the first seven days after fertilisation — could uncover currently unknown contributors to miscarriages. 
In the UK, it's estimated that a miscarriage occurs in 15-20% of pregnancies, with 85% of miscarriages occurring in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
""The reason why it is so important is because miscarriages and infertility are extremely common, but they're not very well understood,"" Dr Kathy Niakan of the Francis Crick Institute said earlier this year. 
See also: Finding hope when a pregnancy suddenly ends
In an emailed statement, the HFEA said it has attached a condition to the licence that any research using gene editing needs to first be approved by the Research Ethics Committee.
""Dr Niakan's proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development,"" Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, said after the decision.
Prof. Sir Robert Lechler, President of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said in a statement:
It is reassuring to see the HFEA approving Dr Niakan’s proposal. Studies such as this, that focus on asking basic questions about human-embryo development, are needed to help answer the many scientific and ethical questions remaining in this field. Genetic editing may in the future be applied clinically, to treat or prevent otherwise untreatable and serious genetic diseases. It is important that an open debate continues between not just researchers, but ethicists, healthcare professionals, regulators, relevant patients and their families, and the wider public. Dr Niakan's study will not just help to advance the biomedical sciences, but will further inform this ongoing debate, while keeping the UK at the forefront in the field.
Last year, Chinese researchers made the first attempt at modifying genes in human embryos. Their laboratory experiment didn't work but raised the prospect of altering genes to repair the genes of future generations.
Scientists say such techniques could lead to treatments for inherited conditions.
Around the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what kind of research on embryos that will change the genes of future generations, is allowed. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund this kind of research but private funding is allowed.
Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to a slippery slope.
""This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalisation of (genetically modified) babies,"" said David King, of anti-gene manipulation group Human Genetics Alert, last month when the British fertility regulator held its meeting to decide on granting the gene editing license.
The Associated Press contributed reporting.

34,Cameron Joseph,http://mashable.com/people/cameronjoseph/,812,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa — Donald Trump's whole campaign has been based on winning. But after a major setback in Iowa, he's now going to have to cope with being seen as a loser — at least for now.
Trump's disappointing second-place finish in the key early-voting state on Monday night, barely ahead of Marco Rubio, comes after recent polls showed him ahead of Ted Cruz. He's now facing huge pressure to hold onto his lead in New Hampshire, where recent polls have him with three times the support of any of his competitors.
See also: Donald Trump, you're the loser: Cruz wins Iowa
Trump was remarkably gracious and restrained — and unusually brief — as he sought to portray the setback as a victory after he barely finished ahead of Marco Rubio in the state.
""I was told ‘do not go to Iowa, you can’t  even finish in the top 10,'"" he said in a speech that barely reached three minutes, spinning the results hard. ""We finished second and I have to tell you something, I’m honored, just honored, and I want to congratulate Ted. ... We’re just so happy with the way everything worked out.""

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump blows a kiss to the crowd after conceding defeat in the Iowa Caucus during his President Caucus Watch Party at the Sheraton Hotel on February 1, 2016 in Des Moines, Iowa. Image: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThat's a far cry from Trump's declaration earlier this week that if he didn't win Iowa's caucuses all the time he spent in the state would have been a ""big fat beautiful... waste of time.""
Even after recent polls proved wrong and let him down, Trump expressed faith in surveys, pointing to a recent poll that had him up by 28 points in New Hampshire. But those numbers are certain to move after Cruz's win and Rubio's strong third-place showing.

“No one remembers who came in second.” -  Walter Hagen
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2013

The brash billionaire has been the bully of the race, smacking down all comers who attacked him as he remained king of the GOP hill. And while Cruz was always a better natural fit for Iowa, Trump has leaned so hard into portraying himself as unbeatable that he'll need to restore that aura almost immediately.
Trump will need to right his ship soon with a win in New Hampshire or soon thereafter — or his core argument that he should win because he's a winner will smash against the rocks and sink like a stone as more traditionally conservative candidates float past him.

35,Nick Jaynes,http://mashable.com/people/nickjaynes/,885,"Jaguar Land Rover announced Monday morning that it is putting five highly automated vehicles on U.K. roads this year to test both connectivity and self-driving tech.
Imagine, for example, if your car knew about a patch of black ice before it crossed it and warned you so you could avoid.

Image: Jaguar Land RoverSee also: End of an era: Land Rover Defender production stops today
This project is part of a much bigger vision than just black ice warnings, however.
The JLR vehicles are joining the £5.5-million ($7.9 million) U.K. Connected Intelligent Transport Environment (UK-CITE) project that includes 100 vehicles and a 41-mile test corridor between Coventry and Solihull, England. The project will utilize newly installed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems on public roads that will send information about traffic jams and road conditions before they can be seen.
Before self-driving cars can dominate the roadways, they'll need a tech infrastructure to support them. After all, exterior-mounted vehicle sensors can only see so far. During inclement weather, they can't see much at all, in fact. In order to reduce congestion and operate most efficiently, autonomous cars will need V2V and V2I communication to know what's coming.
This will allow autonomous cars to do something called ""platooning"" in which cars gather together in a tailgating formation. Not only would this make the fleet more efficient and also reduce the amount of space each car requires on the road. Of course, however, this sort of maneuver would require nonstop communication in order to be safe.
Essentially, freeways of the future will be full of connected-car chatter, which will allow you to sit back, relax and watch Game of Thrones during your daily commute. And this the first step toward that Utopia.

Liam Neeson meets with a younger version of himself — played by the actor's real-life son Micheál Neeson — to discuss the time-traveling transport of LG's OLED television from the future in the electronics company's first-ever Super Bowl ad. 
See also: Super Bowl advertisers just want America to have fun this year
The plot, if there is one, is not easily untangled. But the threat of some unnamed nefarious force that apparently wants to halt the TV's release makes the 60-second spot, which was produced by Ridley Scott, feel more like a trailer for a sci-fi thriller than a prosaic consumer electronics commercial. It ends with the younger Neeson inexplicably riding off on a motorcycle into a Tron-like maze.

37,Nina Roberts,[],3000,"Your coworker received a phone call, her voice dropped from pleasant to distraught in seconds; there was a death in the family. She’s now back at the office after time off, typing at her keyboard. Do you leap to her side and cradle her in your bosom? 
Summarize those moving posts by author and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote, ""I want to choose life"" after her husband died? Keep it professional with a quick condolence on the way to the printer? Or play dumb and act as if nothing happened?
Grief at the workplace can be uncomfortable. Conversations with coworkers tend to revolve around work and deadlines with a sprinkling of bon mots and light musings; suddenly it’s time to acknowledge a colleague’s deeply personal grief. 
It’s challenging to know where the professional persona ends and the humanity begins when a coworker has lost a loved one.
Here's the first thing to know: there is no one way to grieve, and no best way to talk about it. It depends on empathy and respect for another person's emotional state, going far deeper than the usual work conversation. 
Silicon Valley based executive coach Anna Ranieri, who holds advanced degrees in both business and psychology, suggests to start with the basics: “I’m sorry to hear about your loss.” Preferably face-to-face. There’s no need to exhibit Shakespearean poetic eloquence: simple empathy suffices, letting the bereaved know coworkers are willing to chat, listen, or help. 
""Take the time to listen,” says Ranieri, “you can follow up in a way that is helpful.”
One can assume a brusque “I’m fine, no big deal,” generally indicates that the bereaved would rather not delve into the death at work, which Ranieri stresses to respect, rather than railroading a taciturn colleague into “coffee klatch mode,” as she puts it.  

Image: Image: Luiz Alberto/Keystone/Getty ImagesA more animated response to a simple “I heard about what happened, I’m sorry,” might signal that talking further would be a comfort. “If you want to talk, should we chat now or meet for coffee later?” Ranieri suggests as a response.
“The mistake most people make is ignoring it as if it didn’t occur,” says Joyce E. A. Russell, the Senior Associate Dean at the Robert H. School of Business in Maryland, of a colleague’s death in the family. “We are afraid we are going to say the wrong thing or set them off into this tailspin of crying,” says Russell, also an industrial and organizational psychologist. 
Russell believes avoiding a bereaved colleague is hurtful and ultimately confusing.  Most employees haven’t studied their employer’s bereavement policies and many don’t know a policy exists. 
In the USA, a private employer is not obligated by federal law to give paid leave to employees for a relative’s funeral arrangements or attendance, though most do. 
Union contracts usually have a bereavement leave in the agreement. Three to five paid days is considered standard for bereavement leave, also called funeral leave.
“It would be very unlikely that someone would stand on their legal rights and say, ‘You can’t leave,’” says Samuel Estreicher, the Director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at NYU Law, where he also teaches. “In fact, in my experience,” says Estreicher, “many employers shut down the shop and they all go to the memorial service, so it really depends.” 
Policies are often outlined on the employer or union’s website, intranet or handbook. A good example is the insurance and finance company The Hartford [http://www.thehartford.com/newhire/hr-policy-process/bereavement-policy/], which clearly states the number of days allotted, what type of employee is eligible, and who is considered an “immediate family member.” 
If an employee needs additional days off, vacation or personal days can be used or request unpaid leave. Bereavement leave is not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Managers are usually the first to be alerted of an employee’s death in the family. Ranieri notes it’s important for a managers to ask directly, “What would you like me to say to your coworkers?“ so the manager doesn’t feel they are betraying a confidence when coworkers start to inquire about their colleague’s absence. 
Managers take responsibility for workload redistribution and might organize flowers or a donation in honor of the coworker’s deceased relative. 
When an employee has returned to the office, he or she might be teary, less productive or have difficulty concentrating, resulting in heavier workloads for others. That may go on for a while, since grief is diffuse and hard to predict. 
“That is the time to be empathic,” says Ranieri. The manager can suggest a few more days off if policy allows. However, many employees want to resume work, even if they are not fully productive. 
A colleague who has experienced a death in the family should be cut some slack, says Ranieri, adding, “It’s an opportunity that we don’t always have to show our care for each other.”

Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote about how to approach someone who is grieving when her husband passed suddenly last year. Image: Eric Risberg/Associated PressDespite the variety of workplace cultures and personality types, a set of general workplace guidelines can be followed at the workplace:
Do acknowledge a colleague’s loss.
If a face-to-face interaction is beyond the capabilities of the painfully shy, a simple card left on a coworker’s desk or mailbox is fine. If the grieving person is several generations older and much higher in rank, Ranieri says a card could be preferable; address it to Mr. or Ms.  
Don’t judge and think a colleague should grieve like you did
Don’t verbalize, hint, or suggest with body language like eye rolling that a colleague should have kicked their mourning to the curb months ago. Or the opposite: “Oh my gosh, I can’t believe you’re already back at work and you just lost your mom,” Russell gives as an example, adding, “That is insensitive.” 
Do remember grief isn’t always processed in a linear fashion.
“Like getting better day by day by day,” explains Ranieri. Grief has no timeline. It may recede for minutes or hours and then come back for days. Understand that it is always there in some form. 
Don’t assume that you know how a coworker is feeling.
Grief is complicated. When an elderly parent dies who had been living with dementia for years, or in pain, some feel a sense of relief when the family member passes, because they are finally at rest from their pain and confusion. Refrain from saying, “Oh, you must feel terrible.”
Don’t post anything about your colleague’s situation on social media.
Also don't spread it around the workplace unless he or she has requested. An influx of comments may be more than they can handle. 
Do remember that the death of a pet can be devastating.
The death of a four-legged family member can be crushing. “Pets can be very important to people’s lives,” says Russell. It’s not ridiculous to express condolences to a coworker who lost a pet.
Don’t give unsolicited advice.
Instead, offer help and support. If you’ve experienced a similar situation, refrain from telling your coworker the details, implying they should follow suit. Instead, Ranieri suggests, “It took a while for me to get over this, if it’s like that for you and I can be helpful, please let me know.” If a colleague asks for advice outside of your scope of knowledge, don’t be a hero and give a mash-up of what you overheard on a Dr. Phil Show and that self-help book jacket you read; instead, tell them you’ll find helpful resources.

But what about malware that’s hidden outside of your hard drive, in the very code that tells your computer how to boot?
See also: The History of Computer Viruses [INFOGRAPHIC]
VirusTotal, a malware-hunting subsidiary of Google, announced in a blog post it has a new tool that scans your computer's BIOS and UEFI firmware for malicious content. Your BIOS or UEFI are the links between your hardware and your software, and that firmware tells your computer how to boot. If there is malware present in that area of your computer, even replacing your hard drive won’t remove it — it exists in a chip on your motherboard.
This malware can repeatedly install software onto your computer before the operating system loads.
According to the blog post, the effort to focus on scanning firmware is in response to recent reports of certain kinds of malware targeting the BIOS and UEFI of certain machines — specifically incidents regarding Lenovo and Hacking Team.
If VirusTotal’s new tool works, PC owners should have a little less to worry about, though you need a web connection to use it. The tool allows researchers to upload firmware images, which the tool examines by extracting executable code where malware might be present. The process then tells users whether there is malware present or not.

After a result deemed by state officials to be the closest in Iowa caucus history, Sanders said ""as much information as possible should be made available"" about his narrow loss to Hillary Clinton. 
See also: Hillary Clinton barely won, but Bernie Sanders is the true champion
Speaking to reporters on a flight from Des Moines to New Hampshire on Tuesday, the senator called on Iowa state Democrat officials revisit the vote counts — precinct by precinct, according to a report from The Guardian. 
“I honestly don’t know what happened. I know there are some precincts that have still not reported. I can only hope and expect that the count will be honest,” he said.
But Sanders wasn't the only one questioning the outcome in the state. Supporters were pitching their own conspiracy theories on unreported precincts as well as the controversial coin toss that decided how some delegates were awarded.
The top three topics on Reddit's popular conspiracy channel were all Sanders related on Tuesday morning. 
One claimed a Clinton supporter and precinct chair lied about the vote counting in Des Moines Precinct 43, speculated about how Clinton won six coin tosses to break ties in certain areas, and another thread claiming the state's Democratic Party was missing votes from dozens of precincts — a fact the party itself denied, saying all the votes were counted.
On Twitter, people pointed to the Microsoft software being used by precincts to tally the votes as a potential source of misreported votes, especially after the platform suffered an outage during the caucus.
The Sanders campaign had previously questioned using the platform, with aides noting that Microsoft executives had donated hundreds of thousand of dollars to Clinton throughout her career.

Didn't think I'd say this, I like the way Bernie Sanders is not conceding & he is the only candidate who spoke against microsoft app. #Trump
— #MatthewSix33 (@SanctuaryForUs) February 2, 2016

Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders for a win in Iowa, though Democrats had outstanding results in one precinct — Des Moines precinct 42, until late Tuesday morning. 

Des Moines 42 is the last precinct left to report. Bill Clinton was president #42. Hmmm. #IowaCaucus
— Bernito Sanderos (@BernitoSanderos) February 2, 2016

Sanders eventually won that precinct though that had no effect on the overall outcome in the state.
In other precincts, the results were so close that delegates for either candidate were being determined by a traditional coin toss.

Some Bernie supporters, like this Iowa grassroots organizing group, were quick to point out the archaic nature of the coin toss.
""From experience, some of the rules with the Iowa Democratic party, some of the rules are a little outdated because they don’t get used very often,"" said Quinn Symonds, who is part of the Iowa for Bernie grassroots group and a delegate in the state.

Hey, coin flips are serious business in Iowa. We save them for serious stuff like for when who gets the family dog after a divorce.
— Iowa for Bernie (@Iowa4Bernie) February 2, 2016

Sanders' result in the state has galvanized his campaign as he heads into the New Hampshire primary next week.
“Tonight is a wonderful start to the national campaign,” Sanders said on Monday.  “Tonight shows the American people that this is a campaign that can win.”
Amid all the confusion and conspiracies on Tuesday, one thing was clear: the Democratic primary fight isn't over. 
""What we saw last night with the democrats, this is what we want,"" said Symonds. ""This is going to change the political climate in the United States and open the door of more progressive candidates to step into the arena.""

This story was updated at 7:55 p.m. ET.
A passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Somalia on Tuesday when an explosion shortly after takeoff tore a large, gaping hole in its fuselage.
Two people were hurt in the incident onboard the Dijbouti-bound Daallo Airlines flight, officials told BBC News, which occurred at 10,000 feet over Mogadishu. Local reports also suggested that at least one man was blown out of the plane.
Mohamed Hassan, a police officer in nearby Balad town, said residents had found the dead body of an old man who might have fallen from a plane. Balad is an agricultural town about 18 miles north of Mogadishu.
A photo of the plane's exterior that was taken once it had landed shows the massive hole, just above the wing.

Awale Kullane, Somalia's ambassador to the United Nations, posted video he shot onboard the plane after the blast. It showed oxygen masks hanging overhead while wind rushes through the hole and into the plane's cabin. Passengers, some with their phones out, sit calmly.

""We just heard a loud noise and couldn't see anything but smoke for a few seconds, when visibility returned we realized quite a chunk of the plane missing,"" Kullane wrote of the incident.
Another of the plane's passengers Mohamed Ali told the Associated Press that they heard a bang before flames opened a gaping hole in the plane's side.
""I don't know if it was a bomb or an electric shock, but we heard a bang inside the plane,"" he said, adding he could not confirm reports that passengers had fallen from the plane.
""I think it was a bomb,"" said the Serbian pilot, Vladimir Vodopivec, who was quoted by Belgrade daily Blic. ""Luckily, the flight controls were not damaged so I could return and land at the airport. Something like this has never happened in my flight career. We lost pressure in the cabin. Thank god it ended well,"" the 64-year-old pilot said.
Somali officials said the incident is under investigation and it wasn't yet clear what caused the blast. Initial reasons given ranged from fuselage failure to an oxygen tank that blew up. Foul play, while not initially suspected, may be to blame.
One source told CNN that initial tests of the damaged aircraft ""came back positive for explosive residue.""

Even though Netflix doesn't report ratings, the series premiered to much critical acclaim, solidified Ansari's post-Parks and Rec career and was considered a lock for renewal. In fact, we're surprised it took this long. 
Ansari tweeted out word of the renewal Thursday afternoon:

The good news comes just a few weeks after Netflix renewed freshman Marvel hit Jessica Jones and several others during the Television Critics Association awards. At the time, it was expected that Master of None would pick up a new season order as well, but CEO Ted Sarandos only hinted that good news for the series was on the way.
Ansari, meanwhile, oversaw a panel about his show and spoke about Season 2 with confidence, even if it wasn't official at the time. 
""Season 2, you know, I think we’re figuring it out,"" he said. ""I definitely need some time to refill my head with the first season was so personal, and I just want to make sure that whatever we do for Season 2 lives up to what we made in the first season. And I really had such a great experience partnering with Netflix and working with this whole group of people. So, yeah, we’d love to do it, and we’re figuring it out.""

47,Juana Summers,http://mashable.com/people/juanasummers/,1600,"



Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign just released a powerful, four-minute video featuring the daughter of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who died after being put in a chokehold by a white police officer in New York in July 2014.
In the ad, Erica Garner remembers the death of her father, saying that ""no one gets to see their parent's last moments.""

""I was able to see my dad die on national TV. They don't know what they took from us ... He was loved dearly.""
Garner says she believes Sanders ""is a protester"" and isn't ""scared to go up against the criminal justice system.""

Sanders campaign has a 2-minute Erica Garner vid they will air on national cable. They tried to buy 4 min on CNN, MSNBC, BET — turned down
— Kasie Hunt (@kasie) February 11, 2016

Garner endorsed Sanders's presidential bid last month, calling Sanders ""our strongest ally.""
The ad comes as Sanders and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton are fighting for the black vote, with both campaigns touting endorsements from prominent African Americans.
On Thursday, Clinton picked up the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC. Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights leader, dismissed Sanders's 1960s work on racial equality, telling reporters Thursday: ""I never saw him, I never met him.""
The endorsements come ahead of South Carolina's Feb. 27 primary, which has a strong African American voter base.

48,The Associated Press,[],1000,"A blowout at a natural gas well that gushed uncontrollably for 16 weeks and drove thousands of residents from their Los Angeles homes was plugged Thursday, a utility said.
While the well still needs to be permanently sealed with cement and inspected by state regulators, the announcement by Southern California Gas Co. marked the first time the leak has been under control since it was reported Oct. 23.
See also: California gas leak is emitting 4.5 million cars' worth of pollution every day
""We have temporarily controlled the natural gas flow from the leaking well and begun the process of sealing the well and permanently stopping the leak,"" Jimmie Cho, a SoCalGas senior vice president, said in a statement.
The company also says it expects the incident will cost at least $250 million to $300 million and that the cost estimates don't include potential damages from more than two dozen lawsuits, penalties from government agencies and expenses to mitigate pollution.

If the plug holds and all goes according to plan to seal the well, the upscale Porter Ranch neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley could begin to return to normalcy after schools were closed and about 6,000 families were uprooted as they complained of headaches, nausea, nosebleeds and other symptoms as an intermittent stench wafted through the area.
Public health officials blamed their woes on an odorant added to gas so it can be detected and have said they don't expect longterm health impacts.
The leak at the largest underground gas storage reservoir in the West was declared an emergency by California's governor. At its peak, the leak was estimated to contribute about a quarter of the state's climate-altering methane emissions, leading some to call it the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
While the gas was invisible, its impact could be seen in half-vacant subdivisions, two shuttered schools and on the faces of angry residents who packed public meetings and community forums and demanded the Aliso Canyon storage facility be shut down.

Tera Lecuona, resident of the heavily-impacted Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles, holds a protest sign during a hearing in Granada Hills over a gas leak at Southern California Gas Company's Aliso Canyon Storage Facility.Image: Richard Vogel/Associated PressThe blowout happened in a 60-year-old well that was built to pump oil from porous rock a mile-and-a-half below the Santa Susana Mountains. After the oil ran dry in the 1970s, the field of 115 wells was reused to store natural gas.
When demand and prices were low, gas was injected at high pressure in the ground. It was piped out during cold months or to fuel gas-run electricity plants during energy spikes.
Regulators will use high-tech equipment to survey the ruptured pipe for clues about what went wrong before cement is poured into the well to permanently cap it.
Residents who voluntarily moved out will have at least a week to return to their homes after inspectors certify it is safe.
SoCalGas has paid to relocate residents in hotels, apartments and houses. Hotel dwellers will have eight days to return home and those who moved to other accommodations can stay through the end of short-term leases they signed.
In recent weeks, many people have gone home as the rate of the leak dwindled and air filters were installed in their homes.
Once the well is sealed, though, life for some may never return to normal. The incident has focused attention on the aging facility and the state is investigating the impact if it were shut down to figure out how Southern California would replace a major source of energy.
Some folks have said they don't want to move back, and many are concerned about what the incident has done to the value of their homes. The company is facing more than two dozen lawsuits, some of which seek class-action status.

49,Quincy Ledbetter,http://mashable.com/people/quincy/,2100,"This is a story about how black superheroes can save your life. 
In 1987 at the age of 7, my twin brother, John, was accused of shoplifting from a big box store in Greensboro, N.C., by an older white lady. Even as numerous employees confirming that he had not stolen anything, my mother and I watched as John was patted down in a full body search in the front of the store. After he was proven innocent, his accuser insisted: “Boys like him always steal.”  
That night, my father gave John and I “the talk” — the one explaining the difficulties we will face due to the color of our skin. The talk was far from uplifting. 
Being black sounded like it was going to suck; the whole incident did a number on my self-image.  
See also: The power of diversity: 10 classic superheroes reimagined for today
John and our older sister Candace seemed to do a better job at adjusting. John was a star athlete, giving him an outlet to build his confidence and develop social skills. Candace had a personality to which people were naturally drawn. But I was the smallest, the most reserved, and when I met new people I was always afraid they had motive to physically or mentally abuse me.  
I developed obsessive-compulsive quirks, such as chewing my food (and my fingers) in seven bites at a time, and walking everywhere seven steps at a time. I would spend hours hiding in my room. I became an average student because I didn’t see the point in improving my mind. I would have fallen in with the wrong crowd, were I not afraid to interact with anyone outside of my family. 
Lessons about black heroes in our school were not extensive, to say the least. There was one chapter on slavery in our history books, and one brief lesson on the Civil Rights movement. Mom and dad involved us in the NAACP and frequently talked about black history at home. But my underdeveloped perspective and mangled self-esteem only reinforced my idea that I was doomed to be nothing more but a victim of systemic racism.
But my parents were tenacious. In the summer of 1993, my father noticed my budding comic book collection and saw an opportunity. He took me to a comic book shop and asked an employee to bring out anything with black heroes.  
The dealer pulled out a stack of Milestone Comics: Icon #1, Hardware #1, Blood Syndicate #1, and Static #1. 
I felt the impact of seeing so many black and latino superheroes immediately. Even before reading a single word, I was drawn to these characters more than any I had previously known.  
Milestone comics were unlike anything I had ever seen from a visual perspective, too. The illustrations were inventive and each character’s series offered their own aesthetic. I was moved by everything from the use of color to the texture of the pen strokes. You feel a certain type of energy in an artist’s work when they have the creative license to express themselves freely. A piece of their soul jumps out at you. When done properly, comic art can say more than any words can express. 
Milestone was a subsidiary of DC Comics, founded in June 1993. Usually having such a huge brand behind you means a strong executive hand seizes all of the power. In the case of Milestone, however, the founders, Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek Dingle maintained full creative control over their creations. 
At a time when people of color had less influence in the media than they do now, it was liberating to learn it was possible for me to create something innovative and maintain my integrity.
Milestone comics made me suddenly aware that other comic books could be formulaic. Those tormented hero backstories that I once thought were interesting in other titles suddenly seemed predictable by comparison. The usual good-guy-versus-bad-guy battles became tired. I could see the epic crossover issue coming a mile away. Such tropes made for a decent read, but it didn’t connect on the same level as Milestone’s characters.  
Here were superheroes dealing with real life issues such as drug abuse, homosexuality, disease, displacement, and bullying, just to name a few. They were fighting battles against evil, and against themselves, in ways that paralleled the world I was living in. And still they emerged as heroes.  
Through these stories I gained a new perspective of the world, which increased my tolerance and compassion towards others.
The Milestone character that had the greatest influence on shaping my identity is Virgil Hawkins, better known as Static. Standing in that shop, I could hardly take my eyes off of the cover of Static #1. 
The simple image of a black teenager wearing a Malcolm X hat and shooting a bolt of lightning from one hand to the other is striking enough, but there was something else compelling about this him that I could not put my finger on. 
It was not until days later that it hit me: This guy looked like me. He was a scrawny, dark-skinned, unassuming, geeky kid who didn’t fit in, couldn’t get the girl he wanted, and generally lacked self confidence. Reading Static was like looking into a mirror and staring back at me was a boy with great power and potential. 
For the first time, I was a hero.
Over the next couple of years I developed some confidence and developed as a painter, illustrator, and musician. The other kids at school started to recognize me as an artist, and that rocked my world. 
Before Milestone, I saw myself as a kid doomed to society’s hatred. Now I was that kid who could do art. At last I believed something positive about myself. 
I have always felt there is a difference between knowing and believing. A child can come to know that it has potential through frequent, positive affirmation. But to believe in that potential — that has to be nurtured. My parents always told me that I could be great in spite of the racial struggles that lay ahead, but I didn’t actually believe it until I saw heroes that looked like me.
It’s been 23 years since I was introduced to the Milestone franchise, but it is still where I draw much of my inspiration. Today, I am a filmmaker, photographer, and musician trying to create something that inspires people the way I was inspired by Icon, The Blood Syndicate, Hardware, Static, and many more. 
The imprint was killed off in 1997, though some of the characters carried over to other DC titles and cartoons. (Static is now a member of the Teen Titans.) Despite the popularity of comic characters such as Marvel's Black Panther — soon to be scripted by Ta-Nehisi Coates — there is no longer a whole comic book universe with predominantly minority characters.  
I think about the child I was, and about the children who collect comics in 2016. In the era of issues like Islamophobia and police brutality, their self image may be more under assault than ever. What inspiration do they have?  
The more we can repeat the success of Milestone, the more everyone can see themselves as a hero.

50,Lance Ulanoff,http://mashable.com/people/lance-ulanoff/,733,"A 60-year-old toy icon is officially shaking its screen and starting all over again.
Ohio Art, the company that introduced Etch A Sketch in 1960, announced on Friday that it has sold the brand, including all remaining inventory, production tools, patents and trademarks to Spin Master. 
Spin Master is a fairly well-known Toronto, Canada-based toy manufacturer that makes robot toys like the Air Hog Millennium Falcon drone, Zoomer and, reportedly, a life-size BB-8.
See also: Charming Tribute Remembers Etch-A-Sketch Inventor
While analog drawing toys like Etch A Sketch — a chip-free, battery-free drawing tablet that uses two knobs to drag an internal stylus across an aluminum powder-coated screen — have been eclipsed by digital drawing platforms (thanks a lot, iPad), Etch A Sketch remained a part of the toy and cultural landscape well into the 21st century. 
Though it takes tremendous effort to draw anything remotely resembling real life, the product has carved a place in our hearts and many walks of life — even the political stage.
During the 2012 presidential election, an adviser to Republican candidate Mitt Romney used an Etch A Sketch analogy to describe Romney's approach to the general election campaign. Etch A Sketch sales briefly soared. 
Even so, the sale, for an undisclosed sum, doesn't come as a surprise. The company shipped manufacturing overseas roughly a decade ago and vastly scaled back its Bryan, Ohio workforce. In addition, Ohio Art has struggled in recent years to keep up with the toy market's digital transition. In 2013, the same year Etch A Sketch inventor Andre Cassagnes died, Ohio Art President told CNBC that figuring out a digital future for Etch A Sketch was a ""big problem for us. Big opportunity.""
Now, however, the company is exiting the toy business completely. In a release announcing its sale of Etch A Sketch to Spin Master, the company said it will now focus on its ""metal lithography business and invest in its manufacturing operations in Bryan.""
In addition to Etch A Sketch, Spin Master bought the Doodle Sketch brand, which makes magnetic doodling boards. 
“These toys have been popular for more than 50 years and we look forward to building on this foundation of fun and creativity,” Anton Rabie, Chair and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Spin Master Ltd. said in a release.
As for what Spin Master plans to do with the brands, the company isn’t saying much beyond a promise to increase distribution. One thing that is certain, though, is that future Etch A Sketch red plastic cases will soon no longer bear the instantly recognizable Ohio Art globe logo, which still appears on the ""Classic Etch A Sketch"" models.

Sarah Michelle Gellar announced Wednesday that she will be back to reprise her role as Kathryn Merteuil in the NBC show, which the actress says begins its pilot shooting tomorrow.

If picked up to series by the network — something that would happen in May during network Upfronts in New York — Gellar will star on the show.  
The story picks up 15 years after the film's conclusion and finds Gellar's character married and heading up a youth rehab movement when she crosses paths with Bash Casey (to be played by Taylor John Smith), son of Sebastian (played by Ryan Phillippe in the original movie). Annette, originally played by Reese Witherspoon, will also play a role in the show, though Witherspoon is not set to reprise her role. 
The pilot is set to be directed by Roger Kumble, who wrote and directed the 1999 film. 
The pilot marks Gellar's third television gig following her run on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She previously attempted a return to TV with CW's Ringer and CBS's The Crazy Ones, in which she starred alongside the late Robin Williams. Both shows only lasted one season.

52,Adario Strange,http://mashable.com/people/adario-strange/,1400,"The U.S. Government has declared them unsafe, and the most high profile retailers have rushed to remove them from stores and online. 
And now New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) has deployed a series of large posters warning commuters not to use, or even carry their hoverboards while on the property.
See also: U.S. government declares hoverboards unsafe
You might miss them if you don't look closely, as they look very similar to the normal New York subway posters warning you to watch out for thieves and advising you to stand away from the edge of the train platforms.

A hoverboard ban sign posted in New York's Penn Station, presented in six different languages. Image:  Mashable,  Adario Strange However, in the last couple of days, the posters began popping up in the city's transit stations in a bid to avoid possible fire-related hoverboard accidents. At present, most of the ""Hoverboards Not Allowed"" posters can be seen in the underground areas of New York City subway stations and at Long Island Railroad entrances, featuring large illustrations of hoverboard-riding figures flouting the ban.
""Hoverboards may be the latest fad, but they are not safe because they have the potential to catch fire. Let's travel together, safely,"" reads the advisory. ""You cannot bring one into the subway, onto a bus nor into rail cars or stations. No carrying, no standing, no riding ― no exceptions.""
The message is also translated on the poster in five languages, including Spanish, Chinese and Korean.
Weeks before the government notice went out regarding the hazards associated with hoverboards, the MTA warned commuters that the hoverboard ban was in effect. 
But now that the posters are popping up, just days after the government safety notice, the seriousness of the potential dangers of hoverboard malfunctions may finally begin to dawn on some of the more hardcore fans of the device.

53,Jason Abbruzzese,http://mashable.com/people/jasona/,910,"One thing about online movies: you don't go for the brain food. The selection is often random and dissatisfying. 
Tribeca Shortlist (TSL) launched on Wednesday as an attempt at a different type of on-demand movie subscription service, focused on quality, curation and turnover. The service will only feature about 150 movies at a time, for $4.99 a month with the chance to rise to $5.99 after the first year. 
""I think a lot of us have had the experience on movie services where you're just endlessly clicking through this search spiral,"" said Jeff Bronikowski, president of Tribeca Shortlist. ""When there's 5,000 movies, you always feel like you can keep clicking and find something you like better.""
The biggest benefit: curation. Users will be able to find a variety of movies from major studio classics to indie films, with some smaller movies getting their first streaming run on the service. In addition to movies, the service will also feature celebrity-curated movie ""shortlists"" around certain topics as well as interviews of them talking about their favorite films.
""I would just love it if we became the destination application where people get home on a Friday night,"" he said. ""If they press play on a movie they know they're going to enjoy it because we've curated it for them."" 
He boasted that the movies on TSL have an average rating of 7.3 on IMDB.com.

Image:  Tribeca ShortlistBut with online movie browsing comes fear. 
Sudden disappearances are an issue with online movie services. On Netflix, movies being removed from the system is something of a bug, with licenses running out with little or no notice.
Shortlist has that problem like everybody else, except they want to make it a feature. Movies will refresh quickly, with around one-third of the library turning over every month, Bronikowski said.
A high-quality, cheaper movie service might sounds like an easy sell, but Shortlist faces an on-demand market that is getting competitive and crowded. There's the major players such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Amazon, as well as other niche offerings like Vessel and CuriosityStream as well as free platforms including Comcast's Watchable and Verizon's Go90.
TSL is a joint venture between Tribeca and Lionsgate, first announced  in October of 2014. While it will feature films from those two companies, it also launches with films from MGM, Sony Pictures, Miramax, Magnolia Pictures. The company is also still in talks with other companies for rights to their movies.
The service will be available immediately on iPad and on the web. The company is also working on getting TSL on streaming boxes and a wider array of devices in the coming months.

Charles Ingram has lived in a camp by the busy road since 2012, but was evicted after Scotland's transport agency expressed a ""concern for Mr. Ingram's personal welfare"" and deemed him to be a ""safety hazard and distraction for drivers.""

— ~~ Aaron Sneddon ~~ (@aaronsneddon) September 30, 2015

A spokesperson from Transport Scotland defended the decision in the following statement sent to Mashable:
""Decisions like this are never taken lightly but reflect our responsibility for the safe operation of the trunk road network and our concern for Mr Ingram’s personal welfare. “We have been working closely with Perth and Kinross Council, as the local authority responsible for care and welfare issues, along with Police Scotland, to ensure everything possible has been done to resolve this situation amicably. “The extent of the encampment on the A9 has grown in recent months and it is now a safety hazard and distraction for drivers and, as such, we have no choice but to take this action. “All partners remain on hand to provide any support we can to Mr Ingram to ensure that his welfare and possessions are protected.""
It's not completely clear why Ingram began living by the side of the road  in 2012; The Courier mentions ""an apparent neighbour dispute"" while the Daily Record refers to a business deal that lost Ingram money.

Perth and Kinross council confirmed to Mashable that they have worked with Transport Scotland ""to offer advice on our welfare and support role.""
""We do not comment on individual circumstances,"" the council said in a statement. ""However, Perth & Kinross Council will do whatever we can to assist people who become homeless. This includes offering emergency and temporary accommodation and providing support, advice and assistance to secure the most suitable housing option available to meet the household’s individual needs. 
""We also ensure that people have access to information about the range of benefits available to meet their housing costs. While we always fully meet our homelessness responsibilities there is no obligation on the individual to accept the help and support offered.”

55,Rob Biederman,[],2900,"From an outside perspective, it may seem like job seekers with MBAs and startup culture are ill-suited for one another. Employees with MBAs are often more expensive than their non-MBA counterparts, and may have high expectations of stability and a hefty paycheck from their first job post-B school. On the other hand, teams at startups tend to think of themselves as down-to-earth ""families,"" in which everyone pitches in and gets dirty. Can these seemingly counterintuitive approaches to business really work well together?
Despite the differences, MBA graduates and startups can be a fitting match. Startups provide great opportunities for MBAs in leadership and immediate action, while MBAs bring advanced business acumen that many startups need.
A perfect marriage
In the best partnerships, each side fulfills the needs of the other while helping the partnership as a whole grow and prosper. MBAs bring immediately useful skills to startups that many non-MBA candidates simply don't yet possess.

Decision-making amid uncertainty: Startups need people who can operate independently in constantly changing environments with limited resources, so having someone who can manage others and self-manage drastically improves production. MBAs specialize in leadership and initiative, which help keep everyone on track.
Communicating for results: Especially in the early stages, startups are selling to everyone — customers, prospective talent, partners, media and investors — so it helps to have an MBA on board. These candidates will typically have strong written and verbal communication skills.
Balancing tradeoffs with scarce resources: Short-term and long-term goals can be difficult to balance for many startups. When new fires arise every day, it's hard to put them out while keeping an eye on the future. MBAs have the training to build a startup's strategy and are often privy to a diverse set of industries, companies and vantage points. That kind of wide-ranging experience allows MBAs to see the bigger picture without getting sidetracked by the details.
Driving with analytics: Without proper analytics, startups quickly find themselves in deep trouble. Young companies need to know what's working and why, and they need to know as soon as possible, since most startups don't have the capital to waste on ineffective strategies. While some non-MBA candidates have a talent for analytics, most MBAs have extensive experience and training in that area. 
Leveraging networks: MBAs often come prepackaged with extensive professional networks; this can be a boon for startups. New enterprises always need to find the next client, partner or investor, and the chances of landing a lucrative new contract improve dramatically when someone within the company has a preexisting relationship with a prospect.

Making an impact
Startups benefit immediately from the acquisition of an MBA, but what's in it for the candidate? As it turns out, quite a lot. 
While many MBAs fight and claw for positions at established companies, those who go the startup route receive invaluable experience right off the bat.
An MBA who goes to a megacorporation rarely gets the chance to make a real difference early on. Startups, however, provide MBAs with true leadership experience and decision-making authority on day one. With that extra responsibility comes more room for mistakes, but also more room for meaningful success, providing a wealth of experience in a much shorter timeframe than would be possible at a larger company.
Despite the fact that one of the benefits of working for a large company is the formalized training, nothing can match on-the-job experience. As go-to decision-makers for young companies, MBAs receive that experience in spades. Whether it's deadline crunches, upset customers or hard-to-please investors, startups never have a shortage of real-world hard knocks to navigate.
As much as they like to try, large companies simply can't replicate the culture for which startups are famous. It's more than just the camaraderie that goes with working as part of a tight-knit group; it's the personal investment in the company's well-being and the feeling of purpose that makes startup culture great.
Getting in the door
New MBAs looking to jump in and start contributing at a startup have several options. Like any position, it all boils down to presenting the best possible face and finding the right match. MBAs searching for jobs can may find the below advice helpful.

Demonstrate value. Startups tend to have an ""all hands on deck"" mentality. MBAs don't have a reputation for being eager to get their hands dirty, so breaking the mold can score major points. Even something as simple as volunteering to pick up lunch for the team can go a long way.
Be flexible. At a startup, everyone has to expect the unexpected. By definition, startups lack the set-in-stone business plans that larger companies have established, so an MBA who shows resilience along with business insight will stand out.
Show passion. When networking and sending out applications, MBAs must be careful not to appear as though they're indifferent about a startup's industry. Preparing for meetings by reading industry articles and studying sector trends can go a long way toward impressing a potential match.
Exhibit personality. How well a candidate fits in with the team might actually be more important than his or her qualifications at a startup. At small enterprises, everyone spends most of the day together. MBAs should show that they'll have a positive impact on the all-important startup office culture.

MBAs who arrive on the job ready to get down to business impress the leaders around them. Financial results can go a long way, but for MBAs looking to build a reputation in the startup community, a good attitude and a strong work ethic can go just as far. 
The skills that MBAs can bring to the startup scene are just what many young companies need. And startups may just be the perfect jumping-off point for MBAs to launch their big careers. So while it might seem like MBAs and startups don't go together, they can actually be the perfect pair.

",From B-school to Airbnb: Why MBAs should consider working for startups,,,,,0
56,Jonathan Keane,http://mashable.com/author/jonathan-keane/,6300,"When visiting Florida earlier this year, Parisian Charlotte de Vilmorin — who has been in a wheelchair her entire life — was desperately searching for a car adapted for people with disabilities.
She finally found one, but soon discovered how expensive it was to rent — for 10 days, it cost her approximately $1,000.
""It's very difficult to get around when you are in a wheelchair, because public transportation is not accessible,"" de Vilmorin tells Mashable. ""You can't just grab a cab or rent a regular car.""
The constant lack of options inspired her to take matters into her own hands. She cofounded Wheeliz, a French car-sharing service that easily connects people with disabilities to owners of adapted cars.

There are approximately 100,000 privately owned adapted cars in France, de Vilmorin says, but they may not necessarily be in use every day. Wheeliz offers the opportunity for adapted car owners to earn extra money by renting out their vehicles, helping out someone who needs assistance with transportation.
Car owners can list their vehicles on Wheeliz at a recommended daily fee of €50 to €60 ($55 to $65 USD). The startup takes a 30% commission and provides insurance. In contrast, traditional car rental service Hertz tells Mashable its adapted cars go from €80 to €180 ($90 to $200) per day, depending on the type of car and number days you want to rent. One local French service charges €79 to €199 ($87-$220).
Inclusive and competitively priced, Wheeliz has now spread across many French cities, including Paris, Nantes and Bordeaux, with plans to expand internationally.
""I really believe there is an opportunity there for the collaborative economy and sharing economy to make mobility more accessible for wheelchair users,"" de Vilmorin says.

Image:  wheeliz.comDe Vilmorin knows about obstructions to mobility firsthand, and has even blogged about her experiences living in Paris and the difficulties getting around, calling out everything from businesses with step-only entrances to inaccessible taxis.
She feels wheelchair users will understand the challenges people with disabilities face in finding a car, and will be eager to share their adapted cars in order to help the larger community.
""When you know how hard it is to move when you are in a wheelchair, I really believe you are ready to help and do your best to let the user use your own car so [they] can be free to travel,"" she says.
Wheeliz currently has 120 cars listed with 900 registered users — including people from other countries who are using the site to plan trips to France.
As CEO of Wheeliz, currently working with a small team of a CTO and a business developer, de Vilmorin wants to create a global network of adapted cars for people who need them — and that means expanding.
The company is considering hiring its own drivers and may also launch a smartphone app, though de Vilmorin says these plans aren't priorities at the moment. Trips in adapted cars, after all, are usually planned in advance, she explains, unlike the on-demand nature of ridesharing apps — but she hasn't ruled it out.

Image: TEPHANE DE SAKUTIN/AFPThe sharing economy is very active in France, with car-sharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) services like BlaBlaCar and Drivy. But U.S. giant Uber has faced some challenges in France in recent years, with opposition from the taxi sector over unfair competition, leading to violent protests in Paris. Authorities are now trying to level the playing field between old and new services.
Uber itself has been criticized for not being accessible to people with disabilities, and has even been questioned by the Massachusetts attorney-general over accessibility. However, it recently launched UberASSIST, a service with drivers specially trained in both sensitivity and handling mobility aids, and has introduced visual features in its app for deaf drivers.

Il se trame quelque chose chez Wheeliz... J-5 !
Posted by Wheeliz on Tuesday, September 22, 2015

At the moment, de Vilmorin doesn't believe Wheeliz will encounter any of its own legal challenges.
""When you want to drive a person in a wheelchair in France, you have to pass a test or [get] certification. It's the only regulatory thing we have to deal with,"" she says. 
Philippe Portier, a partner at French law firm JeantetAssociés, confirms that Wheeliz is unlikely to face ""any particular stringent legal issues."" Beyond providing insurance, which Wheeliz and many other P2P companies do, the business is unregulated, he says.
Still, de Vilmorin says legal hurdles shouldn't be a deterrent in tackling disability problems.
""I believe the world of startups and innovation is still disconnected from the needs of disabled people,"" she says. ""To me, it is essential to create and build a sustainable sharing community dedicated to the mobility problem.""

59,Chancellor Agard ,[],1000,"Spoiler Alert: Plot points in the Season 7 premiere of The Good Wife are discussed below 
Let’s be honest: Season 6 of The Good Wife was kind of a disappointment, especially when compared to the show’s excellent and turbulent Season 5. The good news? The Good Wife returned Sunday with a premiere that hit the reset button and feels a bit more like classic Good Wife. 
“Bond” is a satisfying season opener that finds its characters adjusting to the new status quo and sets up a season about redemption. 
Last season ended with the fiendish Louis Canning (Michael J. Fox) knocking on a recently disgraced and unemployed Alicia Florrick’s door and asking if she wanted partner with him. Meanwhile, Peter Florrick was considering entering the presidential race and Kalinda left the show (I’m still not over that faked, final Alicia-Kalinda scene — actually, let’s not even talk about it). 
The emancipation of Alicia Florrick
When the new season opens, we quickly find out that Alicia said no to Canning’s offer because she’s looking forward to working for herself.
“For the first time in my life, I don’t have to answer to anyone. It’s just me,” she says to Canning after rejecting his offer for a second time. 
Alicia is ready to accept her new Burn Notice-esque lifestyle. She’s black balled because of the election scandal, so she has to pick up whatever cases come her way just to make money, whether that’s working in the hellish bond court or working a probate case that pits her against her old firm, which is what happens in the premiere episode. 
Immersing Alicia back in the law and having her juggle work in both bond court and probate court represents a nice return to form for The Good Wife. One of the problems with last season was that the election storyline took her out of the courtroom, which is where she shines. With Alicia back in court, the character is felt more active than she has in awhile. She's so busy, in fact, that she only has time for one glass of wine this week. 
The thrust of “Bond” is watching Alicia figure out how bond court works. Bond court is fast paced and functions much like an assembly line. There’s no time for any of Alicia’s eloquent and prepared arguments. The Good Wife loves to throw its lawyers into different types of courts and watch them struggle with their idiosyncrasies — think “Double Jeopardy” and (Season 2) “Je Ne Sais What?,” (Season 4). It’s always compelling stuff to watch. 
Most of Alicia’s relationships disintegrated over the course of Season 6 and by the end, she was pretty much alone. Thus, one of the tasks of this new season is to help Alicia develop new relationships. 
Enter Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo), a smart, clever and fun lawyer who acts as Alicia’s Virgil through the hell that is bond court. At one point, Alicia gets stuck in bond court and has to ask Lucca to fill in for her in probate court. And, it’s Lucca’s surprisingly deep knowledge of Illinois probate law that helps Alicia win the case. 
The episode ends with Alicia and Lucca sharing a drink at a bar Alicia-Kalinda style, except it’s quickly revealed that Lcuca isn’t meant to be the new Kalinda — Lucca likes to dance and drinks beer. 
It'll be exciting to see where this friendship goes. Kalinda helped Alicia find her inner badass and maybe Luca will help her have fun. 

Eli has a new foe in Season 7. Watch out, Margo Martindale.Image:  Paul Sarkis/CBSEli’s Comeback
“Bond” also featured the end of Peter and Eli’s relationship, which has been one of The Good Wife’s most stable ones. Peter is forced to fire Eli from his presidential campaign because Ruth Eastman (recent Emmy Award winner Margo Martindale), the new campaign strategist brought in to help Peter net the democratic VP nomination, refuses to work with him. 
Eli’s justifiably hurt by the decision and threatens to find a candidate to beat Peter. Eli’s always at his best when he has a challenge and formidable opponent, and that’s exactly what he gets with Ruth. 
After a bit of sulking, he decides to ask Alicia, who gave Peter her blessing to run, to make him her chief of staff for the election, since she’ll need one to help rehabilitate her image as the Good Wife after last season (#meta). Alicia agrees and becomes even more determined to work with Eli when Ruth tries to stop her. By the end “Bond,” an alliance has been formed between Alicia and Eli against Ruth. Moreover, these two characters are tied together by this season’s exploration of redemption; their both trying to recover from professional setbacks. 
Cary’s Post-Kalinda Depression
In the wake of Alicia leaving the firm and Kalinda departing, Cary is feeling alone and lost at Lockhart, Agos & Lee. He’s the youngest senior partner and is having a hard time relating to the people he’s working with. As he looks around a boring partners meeting, he starts to realize that he’s slowly becoming what he hated at Lockhart Gardner: an unapproachable partner that’s out of touch with the associates. 
In an attempt to rage against the dying of the light, Cary reaches out to the associates and invites them out for drinks to hear about their complaints. One of the male associates tells Cary that he feels like the firm is viewed as an older firm that’s not open to new ideas.
Cary brings the changes — which, to be honest, didn’t make any sense and looked stupid — to the other partners, but they reject them. This decision clearly worries Cary because he knows what happens associates feel under-appreciated and The Good Wife’s metaphorical fan can’t take anymore things hitting it. Things get awkward for Cary when the male associate mistakes Cary’s attempts at mentorship for flirting and hits on Cary. 
Cary’s ennui at the firm is definitely an interesting avenue to explore. However, I’m worried that it will ultimately lead to Cary leaving the firm and joining Alicia again. 
Case Notes: — It’s revealed that Canning is the one who sent Alicia the probate case. At the end of the episode, she reluctantly asks him to keep sending her cases, but still refuses to work for him. The Education of Alicia Florrick contniues as she’s set to learn from the Devil. — The biggest problem with this episode: Not enough Christine Baranski.— Evidence the show lost Kalinda long before she left; her absence was barely felt in the premiere. — I really liked the silhouetted shot of Alicia and Peter talking. The Good Wife is one of the few broadcast shows that feels directed. — This week in “This is clearly shot in New York”: The scene where Alicia meets Ruth Eastman was clearly shot in Lincoln Centre.

Whoa!
Before I continue: This post contains spoilers for Sunday's episode of The Last Man on Earth. Scratch that — this post is nothing but spoilers for Sunday's episode of The Last Man on Earth.
See also: 'Last Man on Earth' goes dark(er) for Season 2 premiere
First, a brief recap: Season 2's second episode begins as bleakly as last week's premiere ended. Phil is alone in the burned-out mansion that used to be his Tucson headquarters; Carol is alone at a gas station in Nowhere, Oklahoma; Mike, Phil's brother (a.k.a. Jason Sudeikis), is still alone in space, presumably, although we can't be sure because he doesn't get any screen time this week.

Thankfully, things get a lot less grim after Phil comes up with an ingenious method to find Carol. He launches self-driving freight trains out of the city, painted with a message just for her: ""CAROL, IT'S ME, PHIL! I'M NOT ON THE TRAIN, I'M IN TUCSON.""
Season 1 Phil never would have gone to all this trouble to bring Carol back to him; Season 1 Phil would have been even less likely to confess that he's discovered a note in Carol's old house that reveals the rest of the show's cast has moved on to Malibu. (They're inviting Carol to come along, but not Phil.)
But Season 2 Phil does eventually break the news to his wife. Sure, his confession only comes after much hand-wringing, but still: character growth! Tansy makes good!
Seeing all this happen is the best kind of surprise — but it's not even close to the episode's biggest shock.
Though Carol insists that she can be happy without meeting up with the old Tucson crew, Phil decides to trick her into coming with him to Malibu — insisting that he just knows this is what she secretly wants. (Which does sound a little too close to the old Phil for my liking.) Whatever; the point is, they drive to California and (implausibly quickly) find their old gang hanging out on a beach. There's a sun-kissed Melissa; there's jovial Todd; there's hunky Phil 2.0; there's Erica and Gail and...

Will Forte just saw WHO on 'The Last Man on Earth'?Image: Hulu The Last Man on Earth""Wait,"" Phil says. ""Who's that guy?""
Ron Burgundy, that's who.

Yup. Just two episodes after revealing that Phil's brother is played by none other than star Will Forte's old SNL bud Sudeikis, Last Man on Earth has thrown another huge star into the mix: Will Ferrell, another NBC refugee.
Except he might not be on Last Man for very long. See, the episode ends with Carol sneaking up on the group and shouting a playful ""boo!"" It's all fun and games until Ferrell — whose character's name is apparently Gordon — starts clutching his chest... and slumps down onto the sand. Wait. Did Carol just kill Will Ferrell??
We won't find out for sure until next week. Either way, one thing's for sure: Last Man on Earth still has plenty of surprises up its sleeve.

61,Jessica Plautz,http://mashable.com/people/jessicaplautz/,754,"Hyatt is joining Marriott and Hilton in eliminating on-demand adult entertainment offerings from hotel rooms.
As smartphones, laptops and tablets have grown in popularity, revenue from in-room entertainment — adult or not — has steadily and rather speedily decreased. In 2000, movie rental revenue per hotel room averaged $339 annually; in 2014, it had dropped to just $107.
See also: 11 haunted hotels that you can stay in for the spookiest Halloween
Clearly, Hyatt, which owns 618 properties in 51 countries, has taken notice.
""This content will not be introduced to any new Hyatt hotels, and it will be discontinued or phased out at all hotels,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
The economic benefits of offering adult movies in the room have clearly declined, but when hotels announce the change, they talk about values and vision.
Earlier this year, Hilton Hotels decided to do the same. In a statement to The Blaze, the company said in-room adult entertainment did not meet the company's future goals:

We are making immediate changes to our global brand standards to eliminate adult video-on-demand entertainment in all our hotels worldwide. While the vast majority of our properties already do not offer this content today, this content will be phased out of all other hotels subject to the terms of their contracts. 
We believe in offering our guests a high degree of choice and control during their stays with us, including Wi-Fi on personal devices. However, we have listened carefully to our customers and have determined that adult video-on-demand entertainment is not in keeping with our company’s vision and goals moving forward.

Marriott hotels ended the practice of offering adult video on demand several years ago. The company's chairman, Bill Marriott, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told The Associated Press in 2012 that not only was the church ""very, very opposed to pornography,"" but that demand for the movies had ""gone way down"" because ""if they want that stuff, they can get on the computer.""
The National Center on Sexual Exploitation in Washington, which has led the charge in getting hotels to drop the service, applauded Hyatt's change.
""With this step, Hyatt is proving itself to be a leader among corporations that value a positive and safe environment for their consumers,"" the organization's president, Patrick Trueman, said in a statement.

""Some of our Farm Day guests started pouring their samples of New York wine into their cups of Mercer's ice cream and they loved it,"" Clinton recalled during a talk at Hamilton College in 2013, according to Syracuse.com.

63,The Associated Press,[],1600,"SAN FRANCISCO — So many people have gone so long without buying a new personal computer that the industry's biggest players are trying something different: a quirky advertising campaign. 
The $70 million marketing push aims to highlight how much better PCs have gotten since smartphones and tablets came along.
Rival PC makers Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Lenovo are joining forces with Microsoft and Intel to revive languishing PC sales with ads that don't promote specific brands. They'll be punctuated with the slogan, ""PC does what?""
It's a concept similar to earlier campaigns by beef and dairy producers that sought to extol the virtues of their products.

The Intel Compute Stick, an underpowered PC, exemplifies the industry's trouble getting new buyers. Image:  Raymond Wong/MashableThe PC campaign will tout the increased versatility of laptops that have slimmed down while adding more powerful chips, longer-lasting batteries and higher resolution screens that also respond to touch commands. Many of the screens also detach from keyboards so they can function as tablets, too. Most new PCs are now powered by Windows 10, which Microsoft bills as its best operating system yet.
""With this perfect storm of innovation, we felt it was the time to tell our story,"" said Steve Fund, Intel's chief marketing officer. ""People think having something good is good enough because they are unaware of how much better the PCs are now.""
The campaign, scheduled to begin Monday in the U.S. and China, will include TV commercials on major networks and online ads. The participating companies will split the $70 million cost of the campaign, which will run through November in an effort to entice holiday shoppers.
The ads are primarily targeting consumers who haven't bought a new PC in at least four years — a potential audience of about 400 million people, estimated technology industry analyst Patrick Moorhead.
The PC push comes amid a 3 1/2-year decline in sales that has been driven by a shift to smartphones and tablets able to handle many of the tasks that previously required desktop and laptop computers.
Even the late July release of Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system couldn't reverse the slide. 
Worldwide shipments of PCs fell by 8% from the previous year during the three-month period ending in September, according to the research group Gartner. Lenovo, HP and Dell were the top three PC makers in the quarter.

About half the consumers polled in Gartner's personal technology survey said they plan to buy a new PC during the next year, compared to just 21% who said they have a tablet on their shopping list.
In an effort to reverse a recent decline in iPad sales, Apple introduced a larger version of its trendsetting tablet that's designed to behave much like a laptop. The iPad Pro will sell for $800 and an accompanying keyboard will cost an additional $169.
Consumers who have owned the same PC for several years can now buy a vastly improved model for $500 to $700, Moorhead said, making it more likely the marketing campaign will win converts.
""I think the PC might have its best hand in the past five to seven years,"" Moorhead said.

64,Heather Dockray,http://mashable.com/people/heather-dockray/,63100,"The older we get, the less we’re expected to care about our birthdays. While that may be true for some, it certainly wasn’t true for 103-year-old Mary Cotter, who recently decided to show up to her birthday dressed as the superhero she is.
Cotter told KABC-TV that her friends purchased the costume because she’s a “real life Wonder Woman.” To celebrate the occasion, Cotter headed to the Montclair Senior Center, where she’s been volunteering for the past 25 years. There she served coffee, tea and water to some of her biggest friends. “They call me the barmaid because I serve drinks,” Cotter told reporters.

Currently, Cotter lives alone and drives herself back and forth to the center, where she volunteers five days a week. When asked her secret to living long, Mary said nonchalantly, “Just keeping busy, I guess,” causing all of us to fall in love with her even more.
Prior to becoming a superhero, Mary worked as a swim teacher and a conservationist saving sea turtles. Check out the video of her birthday party (which she casually described as “just another day”) below.

Welcome to your real future, Doc and Marty: fossil fuels and disappointment.
A new animated short by CollegeHumor imagines how Marty McFly and Doc Brown would react after being transported to the real 2015. It's a future of rubber shoes, weird hoverboard scooters and hoards of teen Vine celebrities. And they aren't psyched about it.
Take a lesson from Rick and Morty, guys, the way to exist in 2015 is to be sociopathic cynics.

Well, now you do: Joel McHale and The Soup have a terrifying look into your future, with this fake trailer for the horrible movie you're making into a reality.

In the clip, which you're seeing first on Mashable, McHale takes a starring role as plucky Smiles Emoji, who lives a perfect emoji life with his flamenco-dancing emoji wife and twin bunny ear-wearing daughters. 
It all comes to a stop, however, when emoji poop comes knocking on their door, holding a gun emoji. 
The rest plays out like a Liam Neeson movie, and you must watch for yourself.

Back to the Future fans, listen up.
When customers visit the ""build and price"" page for either the 2016 Ford Fiesta or 2016 Ford Focus, they will be able to spec the compact hatchbacks with a flux capacitor — but only between Oct. 21 and 26 for ""Back to the Future Day,"" the dates to which Marty and Doc travelled.
The price is a nominal $1,219,390; it is powered by 1.21 gigaWatts of energy, after all. 
See also: Fiat Chrysler's proposed labor deal could kill the Dodge Viper in 2017
For those of you who don't remember, the flux capacitor was the key component to Doctor Emmett Brown's time-traveling DeLorean in the movie. Of course, outside of the DeLorean, the option will be a class exclusive for the Ford vehicles.
Once selected, you'll be able to see how the flux capacitor looks embedded in the dash in place of the SYNC infotainment screen. Sure, now you won't have navigation — but where you're going, you won't need roads.

Image:  FordFord does warn in its promotional YouTube video that the use of the flux capacitor is “for recreational use only,"" adding that ""interfering in major historical events is illegal and could have unintended consequences for all of humanity.”
The Ford flux capacitor appears to work just like Doc’s. As the Fiesta or Focus nears 88 mph, the speed at which time travel is accessed, the flux capacitor flashes faster and faster before entering the time-leap. You might want to do this on a closed course — for safety reasons, of course.
Once you're successfully back in time, Ford recommends that you “avoid your past self at all costs, as this could potentially cause a rift in the space-time continuum.” 
You should check out the Ford Mustang while you're back there; though the 2015 models don't look quite like what BTTF may have imagined, its predecessors are still worth a glimpse.

69,Emily Feldman,http://mashable.com/author/emily-feldman/,1300,"Anchors at two Turkish televisions stations, along with dozens of other journalists, fought to keep their stations on the air on Wednesday as Turkish police raided the headquarters of an opposition media group in the early hours of the morning.
Bugun TV and Kanalturk were able to keep their broadcasts going for most of Wednesday from a small newsroom, even after police had entered the studios. But just before 5 p.m., both stations went dark.
Koza-Ipek Holding, which owns the stations, is linked to a movement led by Fethullah Gulen, a moderate Islamic cleric based in the United States. Turkey's ruling government has accused Gulen of trying to destabilize the state, and prosecutors have labeled his movement a terrorist organization.
The conglomerate is accused of funding the Gulen movement and an Ankara court ruled that the company’s assets would be seized, just days ahead of Turkey’s general election.

On Tuesday, an Ankara court ruled that the company's assets would be seized, just days ahead of Turkey's general election. Wednesday's raids are part of a wider crackdown against opposition media outlets in the country which have been widely criticized internationally.

Chants and shouting could be heard in the background as she spoke by phone, saying that her colleagues were reacting to police officers taking the editor in chief into custody. She said they had begun detaining others as well.
“They just told us that we need to get our stuff and take off,” Batu said. She added that her colleagues were refusing and insisting that everybody stay.
MPs from the opposition parties ""came to support us, but at this point, it’s a mafia system,"" she said. ""Really, YouTube, UStream and the station's websites, but that too went dark on Wednesday afternoon.
The broadcast will be cut any moment now. But we remain in the control room. Every minute counts. Watch live on https://t.co/OZG7a17plw— Suna Vidinli® (@SunaVidinli) October 28, 2015


We were live until the police stormed the control room of Bugun TV today. Chief editor @TarikToros was heroic today! pic.twitter.com/tUsgFlF0CD— Suna Vidinli® (@SunaVidinli) October 28, 2015

Emre Buga, an anchorman for Bugun TV, spoke from a newsroom where several of his colleagues had taken shelter from police. He said that the editor in chief decided to keep the show going and guests coming even as police swarmed the office and attempted to black out the broadcast.“Our studios are risky for broadcasting right now, so our editor is continuing programming in little tiny rooms that are just 16 square meters,” he said. “We are accepting some guests and continuing programming but it is really hard.”Buga said that he saw police break tables, among other items, and blocked him and others from entering their offices. For a while, they were even regulating bathroom access. Outside, he counted about 100 police officers and about 50 police vehicles, including trucks equipped with water cannons. He said that in the morning, the building’s private security and reporters tried to block police from entering the building, but that tear gas was used to help officers push their way in.The raid comes just days before the country's elections on Sunday.",Journalists fought to keep Turkish TV station live after police stormed building,,,,,0

He ... wants nothing more to meet his idol Robert Downey Jr (aka iron man) as he has managed to get past the bullies he faces from day to day by telling them the he too has a extra special port in his chest much like iron man has his arc reactor, I am sharing this in hope that mr stark (as Daniel calls him out of the suit) could find a way to contact me on here as Daniel could really do with a little lift at the moment after a child at school has told him that all children with cf die. If this reaches him and Daniel could get a reply I hope that it could help him through his stay in hospital as it is starting to take its toll on him.

The Internet used its superpowers for good, and word spread until Daniel's wish reached the ear of Mr. Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr.
RDJ posted an undeniably amazing pic of himself in a tiger onesie (because that's just what you do when you're RDJ), and offered Daniel an amazing dream come true:
Mr. Stark here. This is for Daniel (@envy_coatings) who was having a rough day recently. When I’m in the dumps, I’ve found this little getup to be helpful. P.S. Would you like to come to the LA premiere of Captain America: Civil War as my guest? If so, have your people call my people. All the best.


A photo posted by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr) on Oct 23, 2015 at 6:05pm PDT

Vicky posted on Instagram the next day, absolutely stunned and touched by RDJ's offer. Daniel will indeed be attending the Captain America: Civil War premiere, and Vicky says he will even be donning a special tuxedo for the occasion.
I want to say a huge thank you to everyone that helped to make this possible and a massive thank you to @robertdowneyjr for Daniels invite to join you in LA, we physically can not believe it and can't ever imagine a way to thank everyone enough, I will keep everyone updated on the build up to the big day on Daniels progress and his day to day going ons and of course his tuxedo fitting that he has asked for today as he wants to fit in like a real star (not that he is not the biggest star in my eyes) thank you everyone this is by far the best wake up call ever when I found Roberts reply (I was a blubbering wreck) 
Just goes to show you: Iron Man be tough on the exterior, but inside he's a total softie.
On an important side note, Robert Downey Jr. needs to team up his costume with Channing Tatum's, because they could make the perfect Pooh and Tigger duo. And by ""perfect"" we mean ""creepiest.""

",Good guy Robert Downey Jr. invites child with cystic fibrosis to movie premiere,,https://plus.google.com/116588835509000494853?rel=author,,,0
73,Lindsey Robertson,http://mashable.com/people/lindsey-robertson/,667,"Daniel Keyte is a 7-year-old who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and who views Iron Man as a personal hero. 
Daniel's mother, Vicky, recently posted a photo of Daniel to Instagram and described how he had been bullied in school for having cystic fibrosis, and how Daniel's love of Iron Man had helped him through those difficult times.

He ... wants nothing more to meet his idol Robert Downey Jr (aka iron man) as he has managed to get past the bullies he faces from day to day by telling them the he too has a extra special port in his chest much like iron man has his arc reactor, I am sharing this in hope that mr stark (as Daniel calls him out of the suit) could find a way to contact me on here as Daniel could really do with a little lift at the moment after a child at school has told him that all children with cf die. If this reaches him and Daniel could get a reply I hope that it could help him through his stay in hospital as it is starting to take its toll on him.


A photo posted by Vicky Keyte (@envy_coatings) on Oct 18, 2015 at 11:54am PDT

The Internet used its superpowers for good, and word spread until Daniel's wish reached the ear of Mr. Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr.
RDJ posted an undeniably amazing pic of himself in a tiger onesie (because that's just what you do when you're RDJ), and offered Daniel an amazing dream come true:
Mr. Stark here. This is for Daniel (@envy_coatings) who was having a rough day recently. When I’m in the dumps, I’ve found this little getup to be helpful. P.S. Would you like to come to the LA premiere of Captain America: Civil War as my guest? If so, have your people call my people. All the best.


A photo posted by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr) on Oct 23, 2015 at 6:05pm PDT

Vicky posted on Instagram the next day, absolutely stunned and touched by RDJ's offer. Daniel will indeed be attending the Captain America: Civil War premiere, and Vicky says he will even be donning a special tuxedo for the occasion.
I want to say a huge thank you to everyone that helped to make this possible and a massive thank you to @robertdowneyjr for Daniels invite to join you in LA, we physically can not believe it and can't ever imagine a way to thank everyone enough, I will keep everyone updated on the build up to the big day on Daniels progress and his day to day going ons and of course his tuxedo fitting that he has asked for today as he wants to fit in like a real star (not that he is not the biggest star in my eyes) thank you everyone this is by far the best wake up call ever when I found Roberts reply (I was a blubbering wreck) 
Just goes to show you: Iron Man be tough on the exterior, but inside he's a total softie.
On an important side note, Robert Downey Jr. needs to team up his costume with Channing Tatum's, because they could make the perfect Pooh and Tigger duo. And by ""perfect"" we mean ""creepiest.""

76,Ariel Bogle,http://mashable.com/people/ariel-bogle/,1200,"Former Australian rugby league star Jarryd Hayne's NFL prospects are looking good.
The Sydney-born sportsman is trying to make it in the American football league, and has been impressing fans and pundits ever since his debut for the San Francisco 49ers in a preseason match against the Houston Texans. But now he's had the best indication yet he might make the final line up: He has survived the team's first roster cut.

On Tuesday, the 49ers said goodbye to 10 players, and Hayne was left standing in the 75-man squad. 
The big test comes on Sunday Australian time, however, when the team will make a further reduction down to 53 men. That's when the world will finally know if the Australian will be playing in big leagues with the 49ers.

— Joe Fann (@Joe_Fann) August 31, 2015

He must also be feeling good about the praise 49ers coach Jim Tomsula heaped on him Sunday after his third semi-competitive game against the Denver Broncos, as Fox Sports reported.
""I’m pretty confident in Jarryd’s ability to field the ball,"" Tomsula said. ""I feel very good about his abilities to field. I feel very good about his abilities to perform with a ball in his hands on special teams. The coverage parts of it? I’ve seen a lot of improvement there. The guy will fly down the field in those areas.
""So, all of those things I’ve seen what I need to see. I think it’s been a great evaluation on him.""
Local paper the San Francisco Chronicle speculated on Monday that Hayne would have a slot on the final 49ers roster as a returner and as a running back.
Hayne has one more chance to show what he's made of on Friday during a game against the San Diego Chargers.

77,Adario Strange,http://mashable.com/people/adario-strange/,1900,"In recent years, a lot of time has been spent considering the future of the automobile. But some have overlooked the fact that the bicycle could use a bit of a leap forward in terms of design and technology. 
A new concept bicycle uses some of the same forward thinking seen in the latest electric cars to deliver a vehicle that might be the next phase in two-wheel cycling. It's called the Eff You See Eye (fUCI), but don't let the unwieldy name fool you, this bike is a work of art. 
See also: This device transforms any bicycle into a smartphone-powered smart vehicle
Designed by Robert Egger, creative director at Specialized Bikes, the electric bike is streamlined down to the inch, making for an extremely thin frame that is nevertheless packed with robust design flourishes. For example, within the bike's frame, Egger even managed to include a small ""trunk,"" that could carry a jacket or other items. 
The name fUCI is an irreverent nod to the UCI, the world governing body for sports cycling, which has exacting standards for the specifications of bikes entered into pro competitions.  

Image: Carson Blume courtesy SpecializedPowered by a lithium battery that can easily be removed or replaced by pressing a large silver button, the bike's docking station would also feature a solar panel, allowing the rider to charge it even when in remote locations with no power. The bike can also be powered the old fashioned way, by peddling, in case you don't have time for a new charge. 
But the most interesting part about the fUCI is its attempt to create a kind of smartbike by putting the rider's smartphone at the center of the vehicle's design. 
""The idea would be that your smart phone runs the whole bike,"" says Egger on the bike's presentation page. ""Everything from disabling it if you want to lock it up, to being able to program in your ride route, or suggest alternative routes if you're trying to get to a specific place. It knows when it gets dark and turns the lights on, lets you know when tire pressure is low, or senses a car getting too close to you and warns you.""

Image:  Carson Blume courtesy SpecializedTo that end, the bike features a special cradle (see top of page) for a smartphone right in the middle of its handlebars, protected by a Batman-style windscreen just above. 
And while it took Egger six months to create the concept, the bike is no where near being ready to deliver on all the technology promises mentioned, as the concept is focused on design, not software, at this point. 

Image:  Carson Blume courtesy SpecializedThis isn't a road-ready vehicle just yet, but even if this is what the future of smartbikes looks like, Tesla and others might have more competition than expected.

79,Nick Jaynes,http://mashable.com/people/nickjaynes/,2300,"For the last few years, Tesla has been playing a game of performance oneupmanship with itself, slowly releasing ever more powerful versions of its Model S, leaving little room for aftermarket tuners to have any fun with the now-infamous EV.
Finally, however, Brabus has taken a stab at modifying the Model S. It's made the Tesla a bit more 'Ludicrous' ... but not in the way you're likely thinking.
See also: Tesla's Ludicrous Mode will push Model S from 0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds
Brabus made a name for itself by taking Mercedes AMGs and making them even more mental. Seeing room for expansion into the burgeoning all-electric car world, Brabus created an EV-tuning arm, Brabus Zero Emission (BZE), which has turned its attention to the Tesla P85D.
Brabus Zero Emission Tesla Model SImage:  Brabus Zero EmissionSmartly realizing it couldn't push much beyond the factory-created 772-horsepower, which will rocket the car to 60 mph from a standstill in 2.8 seconds, Zero Emission instead turned its attention to the aesthetics.
First off, you'll notice it now sports some matte laser blue paint, which accents Brabus Zero Emission's big changes. Engineers have gone around the interior and exterior and added the Brabus touch. In the front they've bolted carbon side air intake extenders, which add a bit of menace as well as a healthy helping of extra air to the radiators. Running beneath the front fascia, BZE slapped a front spoiler lip — also carved from carbon — that reduces lift on the front axle at high speeds.
At the tail end, BZE added a rear diffuser, giving the round-y rear a touch of racing flare while also reducing air deflection. Finishing off the look, Brabus bolted up a set of its one-piece, 21-inch ""Platinum Edition"" wheels.
On the inside, some mild modifications have been made as well. The kick-plate on the rocker panel is now a piece of stainless steel backlit with white and blue LEDs.
Fixing a glaring Tesla oversight, BZE installed a center console over the transmission tunnel, complete with heated and cooled cupholders as well as a wireless smartphone charging pad. 
Brabus Zero Emission Tesla Model SImage:  Brabus Zero EmissionEnsuring the rest of the interior feels sufficiently Brabus-y, seating surfaces are covered in leather and Alcantara and the trim bits can be fitted with real wood and carbon fiber.
If you're keen to get this Brabus Zero Emission P85D that now looks as ludicrous as it accelerates, the tuner will take your money now.

80,Stan Schroeder &amp; Brian Ries,[],1100,"This story was updated at 5:55 p.m. ET with more information on Croatia's reaction to the inlfux.
RAB, Croatia — Thousands of refugees streamed into Croatia from Serbia on Thursday after they were blocked from entering Hungary. 
Authorities in Hungary had used tear gas and water cannons to push back the men, women and children who are fleeing war and poverty in unprecedented numbers, and Serbia offered what many hoped was a safer route on the path to Europe. The refugees, most of them Syrians, are trying to get to Austria and Germany, where they hope they can find a better life. But as the countries along that path are increasingly slamming their doors, the migrants are growing ever more desperate.

At the Croatian border, the refugees again faced chaos, as the country's interior minister declared it ""absolutely full."" Hundreds were kept from entering, as their numbers have already exceeded the capacities of most of Croatia's refugee centers, officials said. Still, some broke through.

And many more refugees are expected throughout the coming days. 
Initially, Ranko Ostojić, the interior minister, visited Tovarnik, a town on Serbia's border, and said the situation is under control. However, he acknowledged the looming issues. ""If larger numbers of refugees keep arriving, we'll have to consider different behavior,"" he said. Ostojić held an impromptu meeting with Serbia's interior minister Nebojša Stefanović on Wednesday, and urged him to try to slow the influx of refugees from his side of the border. 
Croatia's foreign affairs minister Vesna Pusić warned on Wednesday that the country was not equipped to handle the huge wave. ""Croatia can handle thousands of refugees, but not tens of thousands,"" she told Croatian media.

Image: AP Photo/Matthias Schrader/Associated PressSpeaking to HRT on Thursday, military analyst Igor Tabak said the big wave of refugees was not that hard to predict, warning that we could see thousands of refugees entering the country ""indefinitely."" Both Ostojić and Prime Minister Zoran Milanović previously said all refugees would be accepted into the country and allowed to pass toward Western Europe. 
But attitudes had changed by Thursday night. ""Don't come here anymore. Stay in refugee centers in Serbia and Macedonia and Greece,"" Ostojić said. ""This is not the road to Europe. Buses can't take you there. It's a lie.""

By late Thursday a total of 9,200 people had entered the country in the past two days, police said, and already groups were trying to cross into neighboring Slovenia and Hungary. Yet Slovenia, like Hungary, appeared unwilling to take in the inflow. Slovenian police said those freshly arrived from Croatia would simply be sent back there, according to the country's state news agency.
Croatian President Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic asked the country's military to be on higher alert and be ready to act if needed to protect the border from the migrants

Refugees started arriving at the Serbia-Croatia border crossing near the city of Tovarnik early Wednesday, after Hungary sealed off its border with Serbia with a barbed-wire fence. They've so far been reluctant to go through Croatia, as they still must go to either Hungary or Slovenia before reaching Austria or Germany.
A meeting of the country's council for national security, where the refugee situation will be discussed, will be held Friday.

81,Jessica Plautz,http://mashable.com/people/jessicaplautz/,955,"Every day it seems there's a new way to go to Cuba. Even as we wait for the embargo to be lifted (Congress has to do that), airlines are announcing new charters and the historically isolated island nation is preparing for a continuing influx of U.S. travelers. 
At the same time, separately, there seems to be a new smartphone-friendly private jet service announced every other day. There are also a lot of companies trying to make hailing a jet as easy as hailing an Uber.
So of course it didn't take too long before these two travel trends came together.
Beginning Oct. 5, on-demand charter service Victor will let travelers book private jet service along with a custom travel itinerary to Cuba from 19 U.S. cities with just a few taps and swipes on their smartphone. Oh, and $40,000.
See also: Entering the Cuban time machine: An American visits the once-forbidden country
That's the starting price for the basic package of eight people for four nights. Victor is partnering with Cuba Educational Travel to plan the trips. The company is offering service from Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, Los Angeles, Key West, Miami, New York City, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Oakland, Orlando, Palm Beach, Pittsburgh, Fort Myers, Tampa and Puerto Rico.
As expensive as it is, if you've got seven friends with the means, the $40,000 price tag — or $5,000 a pop — isn't as bad as it first sounds for this trip.
Travel to Cuba is expensive for Americans right now, since flights are by charter only — the New York City to Havana charter starts at $850 round trip — and nicer hotels have very limited inventory. High-end tourist activities also come in at relatively steep prices, and Cuba Educational Travel handles the somewhat complicated details of planning a trip to a country where U.S. citizens are still not technically allowed to vacation. (The itineraries qualify as cultural exchange.)
""We're in this unique window where the travel restrictions have eased but the infrastructure hasn't improved,"" David Young, Victor senior vice president, told Mashable. ""This [trip] is really unique.""

Victor, a four-year old company, is one of many services that are trying to make booking a private jet an easier and more seamless experience through technology. Its tech focus could help it compete with the charters currently serving Cuba. There are now nonstop charters from several major cities that are working with large airlines, like JetBlue, but require calling to book. 
Commercial airlines are practically champing at the bit to start regular service. JetBlue said this week that the airline is ""ready to go.""
The relationship between the U.S. and Cuba is still thawing — President Obama met with Cuban President Raúl Castro Tuesday — but Congress has yet to act, and it's unclear when that will happen. (Though ""when"" has more commonly replaced ""if"" when it comes to lifting the embargo.)
In the mean time, Victor is actually ready.
""It's a pretty sexy proposition to book a jet on your smartphone and go to Cuba,"" Young said.
